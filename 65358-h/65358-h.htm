<p><span class="uppercase">he</span> bright spring
days found me a
close prisoner to
the house. The
end of April had
been unusually
chilly, and one
cold rainy night
Reggie was taken
with an attack of
croup.</p>

<p>It was a very severe attack, and for
an hour or two my alarm was excessive.
Mrs. Morton was at a fancy ball, and
Mr. Morton was attending a late debate,
and, to add to my trouble, Mrs. Garnett,
who would at once have come to my
assistance, was confined to her bed with
a slight illness.</p>

<p>Travers had no experience in these
cases, and her presence was perfectly
useless. Hannah, frightened and half
awake as she was, was far more helpful.
Happily Anderson was still up, and he
undertook at once to go for the doctor,
adding, of his own accord, that he would
go round to the stables on his return,
and send the carriage off for his mistress.
“She is not expected home until
three, and it is only half-past one, but she
would never forgive us if she were not
fetched as quickly as possible.”</p>

<p>I thanked Anderson, and begged
Hannah to replenish the bath with hot
water. Happily, I knew what remedies
to use; my former experience in my
schoolfellow’s nursery proved useful to
me now. I remembered how the doctor
had approved of what I had done, and
I resolved to do exactly the same for
Reggie. Frightened as I was, I am
thankful to know my fears did not impede
my usefulness; I did all I could
to relieve my darling, and Hannah seconded
my efforts. I am sure Travers
wished with all her heart to help us, but
she had no nerve, and her lamentable
voice made me a trifle impatient.</p>

<p>It was a great relief when Anderson
appeared with Dr. Myrtle. He waited
for a few minutes to hear from the doctor
that all dangers had been averted by
the prompt remedies, and then he went
in search of Stephenson. It was some
time before we heard the sound of carriage
wheels.</p>

<p>Reggie was still wrapped in a blanket
on my lap, and had just fallen asleep,
worn out by the violence of the remedies
still more than by the attack. Dr.
Myrtle whispered to me not to move, as
he would speak to Mrs. Morton downstairs,
and enforce on her the need of
quiet. It would have been grievous to
wake the exhausted little creature, and
I was quite content to sit holding him in
my lap until morning, if Dr. Myrtle
thought it well for me to do so.</p>

<p>I had forgotten all about the fancy
ball, and my start when I saw Mrs.
Morton standing in the doorway almost
woke Reggie. I really thought for a
moment that I was dreaming. I learnt
afterwards that she had taken the
character of Berengaria, wife of the lion-hearted
Richard, but for the moment I
was too confused to identify her. She
was dressed in dark blue velvet, and her
gown and mantle were trimmed with
ermine; she wore a glittering belt that
looked as though it were studded with
brilliants, and her brown hair hung in
loose braids and plaits under a gold
coronet. As she swept noiselessly towards
us, I could see the tears were
running down her cheeks, and her
bosom was heaving under her ermine.</p>

<p>“Oh, Merle!” she whispered, in a
voice of agony, as she knelt down beside
us, “to think my boy was in danger,
and his mother was decked out in this
fool’s garb; it makes me sick only to
remember it; oh, my baby, my baby!”
and she leant her head against my arm
and sobbed, not loudly, but with the
utmost bitterness.</p>

<p>“Dear Mrs. Morton,” I returned,
gently, “it was not your fault; no one
could have foreseen this. Reggie had a
little cold, but I thought it was nothing.
Oh, what are you doing!” for she had
actually kissed me, not once, but twice.</p>

<p>“Let me do it, Merle,” returned my
sweet mistress; “I am so grateful to you,
and so will my husband be when he
knows all. Dr. Myrtle says he never
saw a nurse who understood her duties
so well; everything had been done for
the child before he came.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Aunt Agatha, if only you and
Uncle Keith had heard that!”</p>

<p>We had talked in whispers, but nothing
seemed to disturb Reggie. A
moment after Mr. Morton came hurriedly
into the nursery; he was very pale
and discomposed, and a sort of shock
seemed to pass over him as he saw his
wife.</p>

<p>“Violet,” he whispered, as she clung
to him in a passion of weeping, “this
has unnerved you, but, indeed, Dr.
Myrtle says our boy will do well. My
darling, will you not try to comfort yourself?”</p>

<p>“I was at Lady S.’s ball when Muriel,
our precious baby—oh, you remember,
Alick”—for she seemed unable to go on.
Poor woman, no wonder her tears flowed
at such a memory. Mrs. Garnett told
me reluctantly, when I questioned her the
next day, that baby Muriel had been
taken with a fit when Mrs. Morton and
her husband were at a ball, and the
mother had only arrived in time to see
the infant breathe its last.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” he said, soothing her,
“but nothing could have saved her, you
know. Dr. Myrtle told you so; and you
were only spared the pain of seeing her
suffer. Try to be sensible about it, my
dearest; our baby has been ill, but
everything has been done for him; and
now he is relieved, poor little fellow. We
have to thank you for that, Miss Fenton.
How nicely you are holding him! he
looks as comfortable as possible,” touching
the boy’s cheek with his forefinger.
“Now, my love, let me relieve you of
this cumbrous thing,” taking off her
coronet; “this mantle will unfasten, too,
I see. Now, suppose you put on your
dressing-gown, and ask Travers to make
you and Miss Fenton some tea. I will
not be so cruel as to tell you to go to
bed”—as she looked at him, pleadingly.
“If you were a wise woman you would
go, but I suppose I must humour you;
but you must get rid of all this frippery.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Alick, how good you are!” she
said, gratefully, and in a few minutes
more she returned in her warm, quilted
dressing gown, with her hair simply
braided; she looked even more beautiful
than she had done as Berengaria.</p>

<p>Mr. Morton soon left us after placing
his wife in my charge. The night passed
very quickly away after that. When
Reggie stirred I put him in his cot, and
begged Mrs. Morton to lie down on the
bed beside him. She did not refuse;
emotion had exhausted her, but her eyes
never closed. She told me long afterwards
she dared not sleep, lest the old
dream should torment her of the dead
baby’s hand, that she could never warm
with all her efforts.</p>

<p>“I can feel it quite icy cold in mine,
and sometimes there is a little cold face
on my bosom, but nothing ever warms
them, and when I wake up I am shivering
too.”</p>

<p>I could not tell what was passing
through the poor mother’s mind, but I
did not like the feverish look in her
wide, distended eyes. Mr. Morton was
right, and the shock of her boy’s illness
had utterly unnerved her. I thought,
perhaps she was blaming herself needlessly,
and yet never was there a human
being more utterly devoid of vanity and
selfishness; she was simply sacrificing
her maternal duties to her husband’s
ambition; of her own accord she would
never have entered a ball-room; I am
sure of that.</p>

<p>I longed to soothe her, and yet I
hardly knew what to say. Presently
she shivered, and I covered her up carefully
with all the wraps I could find, and
then knelt down and chafed her hands.</p>

<p>“You cannot sleep, Mrs. Morton; I
am so sorry, and yet you are tired out.”</p>

<p>“I do not want to sleep,” she answered.
“I dream badly sometimes,
and I would rather lie awake and listen
to my boy’s breathing; he is sleeping
nicely, Merle.”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed; there is no need for
anxiety now, and I am watching him
carefully.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can trust you,” with a faint
smile; “I trusted you from the first
moment. But, my poor girl, I am afraid
you are very tired, and I have taken your
bed from you.”</p>

<p>“I would rather see you resting there,
Mrs. Morton.”</p>

<p>“Do you think you could read to me
a little? My husband often reads to me
when I am nervous and cannot sleep.
Anything will do, the simplest child’s
story; it is just the sound of the voice
that soothes me. What is that book?
Oh, the Bible! I am afraid I do not
read that enough, I have so little time
to myself, and then I am often too tired.”</p>

<p>“It is just the book for tired people,”
I returned; “if you want a story. I
think the history of Ruth is one of the
most touching, she has always seemed
to me one of the sweetest characters in
the Bible; it is a perfect idyll of Oriental
life.”</p>

<p>“It is so long since I have read it,”
she returned, apologetically, “you shall
read it to me if you like.” And I read<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">{147}</span>
the whole book throughout to her, only
pausing now and then to look at Reggie.</p>

<p>She listened to it without interrupting
me once, but I was rejoiced to see that
the strained expression had passed out
of her eyes; they looked more natural.</p>

<p>“You are right, Merle,” she observed,
when I had finished, “it is very beautiful
and touching; that was something
like love, ‘where thou goest, I will go.’
Now you may read me a psalm, if you
are not tired. I like your voice, it is so
clear and quiet.”</p>

<p>I read to her until she bade me stop;
and then we talked a little. I told her
an incident or two in my school-days
about our nutting expeditions in the
Luttrell woods, and how one of our party
had strayed and had encountered a
gipsy caravan. I was just in the middle
of Rose Mervyn’s recital, when I heard
measured breathing. She had fallen
asleep.</p>

<p>I saw a great deal of Mrs. Morton
during the next few days. She was
very unwell, and Dr. Myrtle insisted on
her giving up all her engagements for a
week. He spoke very decidedly, and
Mr. Morton was obliged to yield to his
opinion; but he seemed a little put out.</p>

<p>“It is such a pity all those people
should be disappointed,” he observed,
in a grumbling voice. “Mrs. Granville
had quite set her heart on having us
both on Thursday. I knew how it would
be when you fretted yourself ill last
night.”</p>

<p>“I could not help it,” she pleaded.
“Anderson gave me such a fright; of
course, he thought his coming for me
was the best, but when I saw his face I
thought I should have died with fear.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Violet, you ought to learn
more self-control; you know I dislike to
see you give way so entirely. Well, we
must abide by Dr. Myrtle’s orders and
treat you as an invalid.”</p>

<p>“But, Alick,” detaining him as he
was turning away, not in the best of
humours, as I could see from the night
nursery, “I can write for you all the
same; the library is quite warm.”</p>

<p>“How absurd!” was the reply. “Do
you think I should let you tire yourself
for me? I hope I am not quite so selfish,
my dear child,” for she was still holding
his arm beseechingly; “you must really
let me go, for I am dreadfully busy;
rest yourself and get well, that is all I
ask of you,” and he kissed her and left
the room. He was not often hasty with
her, but he was overworked and irritable.</p>

<p>We made the most of that week between
us. Reggie soon recovered, and
as long as he was kept in a certain temperature,
and carefully watched, gave us
no further anxiety.</p>

<p>His mother took entire charge of him
during that week; she came up to the
nursery as soon as she was dressed, and
stayed with us until Reggie was in bed
and Travers came to summon her. She
even took her meals with us. Dr. Myrtle
thought she was suffering from a chill,
and the warm nursery was just the right
temperature for her. It was a lovely
sight to watch her with her children. I
think even Mr. Morton was struck by
the beauty of the scene when he came
up one afternoon and found her sitting
in her easy chair with Reggie on her
lap and Joyce standing beside her.</p>

<p>“You seem all very happy together,”
he said, as he took up his position on
the rug. I had retreated with my work
into the other room, but I could hear
her answer distinctly.</p>

<p>“Oh, Alick, it has been such a happy
week—a real holiday; it was worth
being ill to see so much of the children;
Reggie has such pretty ways; I knew
so little about him before. He can say
‘fada,’ quite plainly.”</p>

<p>“Indeed, my boy, then suppose you
say your new words.”</p>

<p>“Do you know what I have been
wishing all this week?” she continued,
when Reggie had finished his vocabulary,
and had been taken into his
father’s arms.</p>

<p>“No, my dear,” sitting down beside
her, “unless you wished for me to be a
Cabinet Minister.”</p>

<p>“Oh no, Alick,” and there was pain
in her voice, “not unless you wish it
very much too; I had a very different
desire from that.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you were longing for a
house in the country; well, that may
come by-and-by.”</p>

<p>“Wrong again, Alick. I was wishing
that you were a poor man—not a
very poor man, I should not like that—and
that we lived in a small house with
a pretty garden where there would be a
lawn for the children to play on, and
plenty of flowers for them to pick.”</p>

<p>“Indeed! this is a strange wish of
yours, you discontented woman.”</p>

<p>“No, not discontented, but very, very
happy, dear, so you need not frown over
my poor little wish; everyone builds
castles, only mine is not a castle, but a
cottage.”</p>

<p>“I should not care to live in your
cottage, Violet; I am an ambitious man.
The Cabinet would be more to my taste.”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear,” with a sigh, “it was
only make believe nonsense,” and she
did not say another word about that
fancy of hers, but began questioning
him about last night’s debate. That was
just her way to forget herself and
follow his bent. No wonder he could not
do without her, and was restless and ill
at ease if she were unavoidably absent.</p>

<p>I wonder he understood in the least
what she meant by wishing him to be
poor. No doubt her innocent fancy had
constructed a home where no uncongenial
anxieties or ambition should
sever her from her children, where she
should be all in all to them as well as to
her husband.</p>

<p>I daresay she imagined herself no
longer burthened with wearisome receptions,
but sitting working in the shade
of the little porch while her children
made daisy chains on the lawn of that
humble abode. The mother would undress
her children and hear them say
their little prayers. Hark! was not that
a click of the gate? Father has come
home. How late you are, Alick; the
children are asleep; you must kiss them
without waking them. Hush, what
nonsense, she is dreaming. Alick would
be in the Cabinet; people were prophesying
that already. She must take up her
burthen again and follow him up the
steep hill of fame. What if her woman’s
heart fainted sometimes, women must
do their work in life, as she would do
hers.</p>

<p>The next day the mother’s place was
empty in the nursery. “Mrs. Morton
was with her husband in the library,”
Travers told us. Later on we heard she
was driving. Just as I was putting
Reggie, half asleep, in his cot, she
came up to wish the children good-night,
but she did not stay with us ten
minutes. I remarked that she looked
very ill and exhausted.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am only a little tired,” she
returned, hurriedly; “I have been paying
calls all the afternoon, trying to
make up for my idle week, and the
talking has tired me. Never mind, it is
all in the day’s work.” And she nodded
to me kindly and left the room.</p>

<p><span class="uppercase">ith</span> the approach
of Christmas and
Christmas gifts,
the cares of the
girl members of
a large family
may be said to
arrive at a crisis.
There is no girl
so friendless or so
heartless that there is
no one she loves or
wishes to remind of
that love at this season, while there are many
surrounded by affectionate relations and true
friends, whose love they warmly return, and
whom they wish to please with a gift, and yet
have but a small sum at command, and must
think carefully over its division.</p>

<p>How many anxious calculations have to be
made, what knitting of smooth brows, what
hasty arithmetic on stray scraps of paper,
what self-denial in personal matters to increase
the little store, and then, when the materials
are bought, what secret work is carried on
behind father’s chair, should he happen to be
awake, and in this and that out-of-the-way
nook of the house, so that the all-important,
and generally extremely apparent, secret is
not divulged until the Christmas or New
Year’s morning!</p>

<p>All honour to this secrecy, this planning
and patient work! It is the true spirit of
present-giving; and let not any of our readers
despise it as childish; rather let them remember
that that which costs no time, no thought,
no self-sacrifice is but of little value in the
eyes of affection, and pleases only where the
gift is valued for itself, and not for the giver.
The girl who can walk into a shop and select
the first handsome article in it for mamma,
and pay for it from an amply-supplied purse,
neither awakens in herself or her mother the
same holy feelings that are excited when baby
works an impossible kettle-holder “all by
herself,” and which she “bided” out of the
pennies given her for sweeties.</p>

<p>Admiring and sympathising as we do with
girls who are generous-minded and do not
count labour and time when anxious to please,
we have brought together in this paper, with
the idea of helping them, several useful and
pretty articles that can be made without any
great expense.</p>

<p>For a small present, costing at the utmost
one shilling, the fashionable little “hold-all
bags” are good. These bags are four in number,
and are connected together only at the
top; they are filled with odds and ends, such
as buttons and silks, until they stand upright
and all of a row, and they find a conspicuous
place among drawing-room nick-nacks.</p>

<p>To make them, purchase one yard of good
satin ribbon, in colour either ruby, navy blue,
or chestnut brown, with the reverse side of a
pale blue or old gold shade. The ribbon
should be from two and a half to three inches
wide. Divide the yard into four equal portions,
sew over the sides, and hem the tops of
two bags without decorating them, but work
on one of the other bags a handsome and
legible monogram containing the initials of
the person for whom the present is intended.
Work this with fine gold-coloured purse silk,
and surround the chief outlines with Japanese
gold thread. On the other bag work a small
spray of flowers, either a branch of wild rose,
a bit of heather, forget-me-not, or jessamine.
Sew up these two bags, and hem them round
like the others; then make sixteen eyelet-holes,
four on each bag; make these round
and not very big, and place them opposite to
each other, and at the extreme corners of the
opening. Sew the bags together by overcasting
the first bag with its monogram turned
outwards on the inner side of its opening to
the outer side of the opening of one of the
undecorated bags. Attach the second plain
bag to the inner side of the first plain bag,
and sew the fourth bag, with its decorated
side turned outwards, to the inner side of the
third bag. By this arrangement both the
decorated bags are outside, and every bag at
its base is separate. Finally, take a silk dress
lace, the colour of the satin ribbon, and run
that through the eyelet-holes to make a draw-string.
Fill the bags, plant them out on the
table, and draw their openings slightly together.</p>

<p>These “hold-all bags,” instead of being
filled with odds and ends, are sometimes
turned into flower-vases. The smallest-sized
penny tumblers are inserted into each bag and
filled with cut flowers, or the smallest size
flowerpot, filled with a tiny fern, is used. In
the latter case, a piece of American cloth is
fastened round the pot to prevent any moisture
soiling the satin bag.</p>

<p>The present method for concealing flower-pots
when required for drawing room decoration
makes another simple but acceptable
present. This is a bag of plush, into which
the pot is put. To make this bag of plush,
cut a round of millboard or stiff cardboard
the size of the bottom of an ordinary flower-pot.
Take a piece of plush, in width twice the
circumference of the centre part of the pot,
and in height the height of the pot; sew the
two ends of the plush together, and make a
hem an inch and a half wide. As a finish to
the upper part, just below this hem, on the
wrong side of the bag, run on a narrow piece
of black tape to hold a draw-string, which
make by running in a piece of strong elastic,
that will draw in the fulness of the plush
until it fits the upper part of the flower-pot
tightly. Gather the lower ends of the plush,
arrange evenly round the piece of millboard,
and sew to the latter with the edges concealed,
using strong thread for the securing
stitches. When the plush cover is used, its
millboard foundation keeps the bottom of the
pot (which may be damp) from doing any
damage to the furniture, and the wide hem
beyond the draw-string stands out as a frilling
a little below the edge of the pot. Half a yard
of plush, which costs two shillings, will make
a pair of flower-pot covers.</p>

<p>From America comes to us a novelty in bedroom
decoration, and one very suitable as a
present to a young lady who uses her bedroom
as a sitting-room and likes it prettily
decorated. This is known as a “pillow
sham,” and is a long strip of linen or cambric
ornamented with lace and ribbons, and laid
over the top part of the bed in the daytime
only. It fits the width of the bed whatever
size that is, and does not fall down the sides.
If the worker is an adept at drawn-thread
work, the pillow sham can be made very inexpensively
and of material that will last through
much wear, but when drawn-thread work is
not used, Torchon and other strongly made
lace is required. An easy way for making a
pillow sham is to buy four new hem-stitched-bordered
handkerchiefs, and upon the corner
of one of the handkerchiefs to embroider
the first letter of the owner’s Christian name,
making it four inches high and slanting
it from the corner to the middle of the handkerchief.
Join these handkerchiefs together,
inserting between each an inch and a half
wide strip of Torchon lace insertion, and
bordering the handkerchiefs lengthways with a
line of the same, so that each square of
cambric is surrounded by insertion lace.
Finish with a frill of Torchon lace edging,
which carefully whip to the insertion lace. A
careless bow of ribbon or one of Liberty’s silk
scarves tied in a bow is sewn to the corner of
the pillow sham, just above the embroidered
corner.</p>

<p>When using drawn-work instead of lace
insertion, a piece of linen the length and
width of the sham is taken, and the threads
from this are drawn out as strips down the
width, leaving five squares of plain linen
between them. After working the strips over
with linen thread into a pattern, narrow
coloured ribbon is run down the centres of the
drawn-work, and the linen squares embroidered
with washing cotton of the same colour
as the ribbon. An edging of lace finishes the
border, and into this lace a line of narrow
ribbon is threaded.</p>

<p>Another variety of pillow sham is made by
sewing together five or eight pocket handkerchiefs
with coloured borders, and ornamenting
the same with a large knot of narrow
ribbons of various shades of colour. The
handkerchief borders in this case need not be
alike, but should blend together, and their
colours should be used as some of the colours
in the knot of ribbons.</p>

<p>Palm-leaf fans still find favour as drawing-room
fans, but are no longer left undecorated.
The two newest ways of decorating them are
as follows:—Take a well shaped and strong
fan and paint it with oil-colours, with which a
very little varnish has been mixed, either a very
bright yellow or a brilliant scarlet. Give two coats
of colour, and let the fan dry. Buy
some ribbon half an inch in width; in colours,
black, vivid green, sky-blue, and yellow-pink.
Make a wide vandyke running down one of the
lengths of ribbon by taking the running
thread in diagonal lines across the ribbon
from edge to edge. Draw the ribbon up so
that it forms a number of pointed vandykes,
sew the strips down the ribs of the fan at
equal distances apart, and use black ribbon
more than the other colours. Sew on a line
of red gold tinsel between each strip of ribbon,
and finish the handle with a knot of coloured
ribbons.</p>

<p>The second make of fan requires a piece of
plush, some narrow coloured silk cords, and
various shades of tinsel. The cords are
obtained by buying a yard of a twisted silk
cord made up of various shades, and using the
strands of this separately. Cut the piece of
the plush the size of half the fan, so that it
covers the fan on one side from the tip of leaf
to the handle. Fasten this round the edge to
the back of the fan, and ornament its straight
edge on the fan with a line of tinsel on the
uncovered side of the fan. Sew down each
rib alternate lines of coloured silk cord and
double lines of tinsel, using as many varieties
of tinsel as possible, and arranging the cords
with due regard to effect. Take three long
peacocks’ feathers, and fasten these across the
piece of plush and sew their ends together
close to the handle of the fan. Cover the
handle with a piece of plush, and arrange a
bow and ends of ribbon round the handle and
to conceal the peacock feather ends. Line the
back of the fan with thin silk or dark twill.</p>

<p>Blotting-book covers of velveteen are always
acceptable presents. The foundation for these
is a sixpenny blotter, size ten inches by eight
inches, while three quarters of a yard of
velveteen (price three shillings the yard) will
make two covers, with a piece of brown
holland or blue twill for the inside lining.
The decoration for these covers is embroidery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">{149}</span>
but this is only worked on the upper side of
the blotter, the underside being left plain, so
as not to interfere with its usefulness. The
embroidery can be of any description of silk
embroidery, either oriental embroidery with
its quaintly-formed but impossible flowers and
foliage, or sprays of naturally-tinted flowers
worked in crewel silks, and both worked
directly on to the velveteen foundation; or
silk embroidery finished with a gold thread
outline and worked upon a coloured rep silk
foundation, and sewn on as an ornamental
corner to the blotter; in fact there are many
ways of ornamenting the cover, and the
embroidery the worker is most proficient in
should be selected. If church embroidery is
within her capabilities, we advise the initials
or coat of arms of the owner being worked in
a frame on linen, cut out and couched down to
the velveteen foundation with gold thread or
gold cord; but such elaborate embroidery is
not often obtainable. The way to make up
the blotter is to cut the holland lining exactly
the size of the sixpenny blotter, and the
velveteen a little larger. Turn in the edges of
both, and overcast them together, enclosing the
stiff cover of the blotter between them, and
sewing the blotting paper sheets in when the
cover is made. Bradshaw covers are made
like blotters, but naturally take less material,
and are only embroidered in one corner.</p>

<p>Large photograph-holders can be easily
made at home. These are used for the display
of a number of cabinet photos, and are
fitted with bands, into which the photograph
is slipped and easily taken out. The size of
such a stand is usually seventeen inches long
by thirteen inches high, but they can be made
of any size desired. The foundation is of
millboard, to which a millboard support is
fastened by its being glued to stout tape and
the tape glued to the millboard, with sufficient
width of tape left between the two pieces of
millboard to allow the support to work. The
upper side of the millboard is covered with
quilted satin. The satin is selected of some
bright colour, and the quilting lines are run
as diagonal lines, not as making diamonds.
Three tight bands of satin are sewn across the
quilting; these are two inches in width, and
require a lining of stiff net when made up.
They are embroidered with coloured silks,
either forming a running design, such as a
spray of jessamine or celandine, or with some
geometrical pattern constantly repeated. When
finished and lined, the bands are placed as
diagonal lines across the satin, not as horizontal
lines.</p>

<p>For a photograph-holder the size given, the
first band will be eleven inches in length, and
will cross from the top of the holder to the
left-hand side; the second band will be nineteen
inches in length, and will cross from the
extreme top corner of the frame on the right
side to the bottom of the frame on the left;
the third band will be twelve inches in length,
and will be arranged beneath the last-mentioned,
crossing from the right side to the
bottom of the frame. Into these bands the
photographs are stuck; therefore, they must
be sewn firmly down at the sides where they
end and commence, and stretch tightly across
the quilted frame. On the right-hand bottom
corner of the foundation, which is never
covered with photographs, the owner’s initials
are sometimes worked in black silk over the
quilting lines. This makes a good finish, but
is not essential.</p>

<p>Bachelors’ wall pincushions are useful presents
for gentlemen. They are made of plush,
and are ornamented with the perforated brass
ornament used about the harness of cart-horses.
These brass rounds are sold by all harness and
saddle makers, and cost from sixpence to a
shilling, and for the latter price the small brass
handle by which they hang will be removed
by the shopman, as it is not required for the
pincushion. A quarter of a yard of plush, a
quarter of a yard of house-flannel, and one
yard of narrow satin ribbon are required for
these cushions. To make them, tear up the
house-flannel into an inch and a quarter wide
widths. Roll these strips very tightly one
over the other as a wide narrow wheel, and
keep the strips firm by sticking pins through
the wheel. When a round as large as the
perforated brass is made, cut the plush into
two rounds of the same size and a long strip
an inch and a half wide. Cover one plush
round with the perforated brass, and sew them
both on the face of the wheel and well through
to the back; turn the edges of the round of
plush over the side, and sew on the round for
the back of the cushion; conceal the edges of
both pieces of plush with the narrow band,
which turn in at its edges and secure tightly
round the sides of the cushion. Make a loop
of the ribbon to hang up the pincushion by,
and sew the ends to the sides of the cushion,
and with the remaining ribbon make a pretty
bow, which fasten to the top of the loop.</p>

<p>The newest decoration for white wooden
articles is the poker or burnt-wood work. This
consists of burning down the background of
any design so that the design itself is in relief.
The fumes of the burning wood slightly colour
the parts left untouched, and give an extremely
soft and ivory-like appearance to the work,
which, if carried out with the new apparatus
introduced by Mr. Barnard, is quickly and
easily accomplished.</p>

<p>The articles decorated with burnt wood
work are all kinds of white wood photo
frames, small wooden table screens, all kinds
of boxes, bookslides, book cutters, drawing-room
bellows, salt boxes, milking stools, tubs,
paste rollers, etc. The best designs are
those of large, single-petalled flowers, with
their leaves, such as daffodils, daisies, and
dog-roses. The design is drawn upon the
wood, outlined with a burnt-in line, and its
chief lines, such as divisions of flower petals,
centres of flowers, veins of leaves indicated,
and then the background burnt until it is
depressed, and is of a warm brown deepening
to black in colour. Mr. Barnard’s apparatus
consists of a platinum point connected by
an indiarubber tube to a bottle of benzine,
which is connected with another indiarubber
tube to a small air pump. The latter held
in the left hand is pressed, forcing air over the
benzine to the platinum point and keeping
that always red hot. The right hand holds
the point and uses it like a broad pencil,
keeping it steadily pressed on the wood until
that is deeply burnt in. This apparatus costs
twenty-five shillings, but if several girls join
together to purchase it, there is no further
outlay. Small pokers are used if the apparatus
is not procurable. These are about eight inches
long and an inch in circumference; they are
sunk in wooden handles, and kept hot in a fire;
four to six are required at once, as they soon
become cold. The parts of the wood not
burnt, such as the back of a screen, the legs of
a stool, require to be stained, sized, and
varnished, and the burnt wood is also varnished
(not stained) as a finish. The paste rollers
are used for holding whips, keys, etc. They
are hung to the wall with coloured ribbons,
and have a row of hooks screwed into them to
hang keys, etc., to.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="uppercase">n</span> a former article we
made some suggestions
as to the possibility
of improving
a moderate gift for
music with the view
of learning to play
the organ and
qualifying for the
noblest of service,
that of leading
God’s praise in His church.</p>

<p>We propose now to take up the subject of
training choirs for the same excellent service,
on the understanding that the future teacher
has taken the advice already given as to her
own musical improvement. Personal fitness
for this branch of instruction is most necessary;
as if once the taught discover they know anything
of which the teacher has not more perfect
knowledge, that teacher’s task will be a
hard one. Therefore, there should be familiar
acquaintance with every description of musical
notation. Alto and tenor clefs should be
well understood to be clearly explained when
met with. On this subject we should like to recommend
the careful study of “A Short Treatise
on the Stave,” by the late Dr. John Hullah,
published by Parker, where the whole matter is
admirably set forth and illustrated on its own
technical grounds. The often-heard, but
somewhat slipshod explanation, “Oh! you
must read a note higher or a note lower,”
which leaves the puzzled learner very much
where he was before, will thus be avoided.
Even supposing the alto and tenor clefs are
never met with, the study will repay the intending
teacher by opening her mind and
giving clearness to her musical ideas.</p>

<p>It will be seen, by what has been said, that
we consider our amateur teacher’s first qualification
should be thorough knowledge of her
subject. The second should decidedly be untiring
patience, which will bear with stupidity,
carelessness, want of zeal, deficient ear, bad
pronunciation, and all the thousand and one
difficulties which beset choirs. These consist
generally of volunteers who join with but
little idea of giving of their best to God, and
an impatient teacher would soon find herself
in the lonely position of the last player in
Haydn’s “Good-bye” symphony.</p>

<p>We would next place hopefulness in the
teacher’s catalogue of moral furniture. The
learners will soon find out if they are being
taught without hope of their improvement;
listless work will be the result, and the shy,
anxious members will give it up in despair.
The power of encouraging effort, of detecting
and commending the slightest sign of improvement,
of persuading the members mentioned
above that the work is within their grasp, if
persevered in, is most necessary, and a kindly
sunny disposition ever ready to look at the
brightest side is simply invaluable.</p>

<p>Next we should place regularity and perseverance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">{150}</span>
Without these the teacher can do
nothing. If she works in the best spirit she
will feel that, like David, she cannot offer to
God of that which doth cost her nothing, and
she will be ready to forego little pleasures in
order that the practice may not be interfered
with, or the evening of the week changed.
This last is a most important point; as the
lives of working people, from whose ranks
most members of choirs are recruited, do not
adapt themselves to change, they seldom
receive in its integrity a hasty message sent
round to put off, and of all things, a walk for
nothing after a day’s work is to be avoided.
Of course rules must be elastic and not unbending
as iron, but experience shows that the
above advice is really needful. Regularity in
the teacher is sure to be imitated by the
learners, and steady work must tell in the end.</p>

<p>The next point should be firmness tempered
with wisdom. The teacher must be supreme,
or no choir will prosper. Infallible she
cannot be while here below; but even so,
one will must rule or anarchy will be the
result. Twenty (or whatever number may
compose the choir) views of doing the same
thing cannot conduce to harmony, moral or
musical, and this fact must be impressed. At
the same time there are local prejudices and
fancies in most places, which a clever tactful
teacher will soon discover and understand, so
as to know when she had better give way.</p>

<p>Enough has been said to show that we do
not consider the task of teaching a choir an
easy one, nor will it always repay with success
those who have given it much trouble. The
teacher must sometimes find herself grappling
with the effort of making the proverbial
“sow’s ear into a silk purse.” She has
impossible materials to weld, such as, <i>e.g.</i>,
excellent, but roaring basses, trebles possessing
no high notes, tenors out of tune, and
leaning to amalgamation with treble, altos
none! What is she to do? Courage! Go
on, do your best, teach, exhort, scold, coax,
never lose hope, and if you get no credit, try
not to mind. Man does not know, but God
does, what work you do for His sake, only be
sure that you are so doing it. If the music be
really the unattainable “silk purse,” how much
may be done in teaching the inharmonious
little choir to phrase well, to throw out by
judicious accent the sense of canticle and
hymn, and so lead the congregation to think
of the lesson it contains! How much zeal
may be kindled by the teacher’s energy!
How speedily the broad dialect peculiar to the
place will disappear before a little good-natured
chaff and imitation from one in whose
lips it is seen, even by its votaries, to be
ridiculous! How the ill-used letter “H”
may be helped and restored with the advice of
breathing over it.</p>

<p>The reader will not, perhaps, think us
very encouraging; but it is obvious that
where excellent voices are to be had, forming
them into a choir only needs intelligence and
a firm hand from one who is equal in knowledge
to the task undertaken. We have,
therefore, tried to suit our advice to the needs
of the many, who must perforce work under
difficulty, being obliged to take, not the
materials they desire to have, but only the
heterogeneous ones at hand.</p>

<p>A few practical suggestions and we have
done! Do not attempt too much in public.
Congregations are very critical. One piece of
music badly done will be more noticed than
several faultless ones. On the other hand,
keep on learning some music above the power
of the choir for improvement and interest. In
cold weather, when possible, choose music
which does not try the voices too much by
giving them sustained high notes to sing.</p>

<p>Lastly, work according to the views of the
vicar of the parish, who is responsible for everything
in it; try to carry out in the best possible
manner whatever form of musical worship he
desires to have in his parish church. You
may not be of the same opinion; but you will
gain nothing but good by putting your own
views in the background and thus learning to
obey as well as to teach. And may we not
hope that the loving Father will acknowledge
such work, even if imperfect in its results, as
done by His child to His Glory?</p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">By</span> DORA HOPE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Wilson</span>’s recovery was slow and tedious,
even more trying to herself, perhaps, than to
her nurses. She had always been particularly
brisk and active, and had scorned to consider,
or, as she said, “coddle,” herself in any
way, and it was a great trial to her energetic,
self-reliant nature to be waited on hand
and foot, and watched over “like a baby.”</p>

<p>Ella, entirely unaccustomed as she was to
illness of any sort, save her mother’s occasional
attacks of asthma, thought the nurse was unnecessarily
checking her aunt’s attempts to
help herself, till Mrs. Mobberly explained to
her what different treatment is necessary for
different people, and how impossible it would
be, with Mrs. Wilson’s active temperament, to
prevent her from getting excited and over-tired
if she once began to take any part in what was
going on around her, although a little exertion
might have been actually beneficial to one of a
calmer and more indolent nature.</p>

<p>It seemed a long time before Mrs. Wilson
was allowed any food more substantial than
beef-tea, of which she wearied greatly in spite
of the nurse’s many devices for varying it.
She showed Ella how to alter the nature of it
altogether by making it with half the quantity
of mutton, or veal, instead of entirely beef; or
with all three together. This not only made
a pleasant change, but the doctor told them it
was often found more easily digestible than
when made of beef alone. Then again, both
flavour and consistency were varied by adding
cream, or an egg well beaten up, or thickening
with corn flour, tapioca, wheaten flour, or
rice, while at other times it was served clear,
without either flavouring or thickening, or in
the form of a jelly turned out of a tiny mould
not larger than a teacup.</p>

<p>Gradually, however, Mrs. Wilson began to
take more solid food, and then Ella’s great
difficulties began. By the end of her first
week’s experience of providing real meals for
her aunt, she wrote to her mother that she had
come to the conclusion that it was quite
impossible to arrange dishes suitable in every
respect for a sick room.</p>

<p>“Do pity the sorrows of a poor young
housekeeper,” she wrote, “with three people
to please, the doctor, the nurse, and the
patient, and they all want something different.
First comes the doctor, and tells me I must
now devote my attention to making the dishes
as nourishing as possible, as it is time aunt was
picking up her strength again; so I crowd in
all the strengthening things I can think of,
and flatter myself I have made a mixture
strong enough to restore the weakest invalid;
and the consequence is that next day nurse
tells me she has been up all night with her
patient, whose supper was too concentrated to
digest. Next time, inspired by nurse’s tale of
sufferings, I make the simplest dish imaginable,
which could not disagree with a baby,
and it comes down almost untouched, with a
sarcastic remark from Aunt Mary that when
she is well she does not mind how plain her
food is, but that in her present state of health
she needs something to tempt the appetite a
little. And yet——but I will draw a veil over
the doctor’s reproaches when I ventured to
make her a spicy little dish.”</p>

<p>But on the whole, in spite of her poor
opinion of her own performances, Ella
managed to supply the needs of the sick-room
very satisfactorily; and she was much comforted
on hearing from her mother that even
the most experienced housekeepers find it a
hard task to tempt the capricious appetite of
an invalid, especially when it is necessary also
that the food should be very nourishing, and at
the same time so light as not to overtax the
most feeble digestion, Mrs. Hastings sent
her daughter a list of suggestions for little
dishes for the sick-room, and added, at the
close of her letter—</p>

<p>“At any rate, my child, if your task is
difficult, as I know it must be, it is also
satisfactory, for you can watch your patient
each day able to take a little more nourishment,
or a little more substantial food than
the day before. You are saved the terribly sad
duty of vainly trying to tempt an appetite
which daily gets a little poorer, or of watching
a dear one getting each day a little weaker,
proving only too clearly that all your efforts
are in vain.”</p>

<p>Happily Mrs. Wilson liked oysters, and,
though she soon tired of them, as of everything
else, they formed the basis of a number
of tempting little dishes. The favourite of
these, a suggestion of the doctor’s, was called
“Angels on Horseback.” Ella was very
anxious to know what the ridiculous name
meant, but could get no information from the
doctor, who said he had often wondered himself,
but all he knew was that it was a
favourite dish with invalids, and that was the
name it had always gone by. Each oyster
was taken from the shell, and the beard cut off,
and was then rolled up in a very thin slice of
bacon, tied round with cotton, and fried.
Usually three of these little rolls were enough
for a dish.</p>

<p>At first Ella’s generous nature led her into
the mistake of sending up too large quantities
of everything for the patient, but she soon
learnt that a dish which would tempt an
invalid if offered in small quantities, would be
pushed aside in disgust if large and substantial-looking.</p>

<p>Next to “Angels on Horseback,” the
favourite dishes were scalloped or stewed
oysters; while for a little additional nourishment
between meals, the nurse would often
suggest a “Prairie Oyster.” This exceedingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">{151}</span>
simple dish is not an oyster at all, but merely
the raw yolk of an egg, served like an oyster
on a small shell, with the smallest possible
sprinkling of salt and pepper over it. The
white must be very carefully strained off, so
as to preserve the yolk unbroken, and it can
then be slipped into the mouth and swallowed
without any trouble to the patient.</p>

<p>Two other favourite dishes which the cook
was particularly clever in making were
jellied veal and faggots. For the former a
small knuckle of veal was boiled till the meat
slipped easily off the bones, which were then
taken out. The meat was cut into very small
pieces, and pepper, salt, mace, and thyme
added to taste, with a small shalot chopped
very fine. This was all put back into the
liquor, and boiled again till it was thick, and
then turned into a mould. When cold it
formed a stiff jelly. Ella always found the
flavouring a difficulty, for Mrs. Wilson’s taste
as an invalid was of course very different from
what it was when in health, and her digestion
was very easily upset; but the cook obstinately
declared that she knew her mistress’s tastes
better than Ella, and in spite of all orders persisted
in putting in flavouring according to her
own fancy; so that many dishes which might
have been simple and nourishing enough to be
frequently asked for, had to be altogether prohibited,
as being too spicy for the invalid’s
delicate digestion.</p>

<p>For the faggots, a rump steak was cut into
thin strips of about three inches by two, and
on these was spread a little butter, with
pepper, salt, and the smallest atom of minced
shalot, or sometimes a few herbs. The strips
were then rolled up, tied with string, and
fried in butter or clarified dripping, and served
up in gravy.</p>

<p>Then there were the different kinds of
panada, made of slices of chicken or game
cut off the bones, and scraped and pounded,
and gently simmered in milk; not to mention
the numberless ways of cooking eggs, buttered,
scrambled, poached, and boiled, besides omelettes,
custards, and milk puddings of all
descriptions.</p>

<p>At last, Mrs. Wilson began to show signs
of real improvement, and as her strength returned
she was allowed to spend part of every
day on her comfortable, old-fashioned sofa,
while a few visitors were admitted to see her.
The nurse kept a very watchful eye over these
visitors, and after their departure sometimes
expressed herself in very strong language to
Ella, saying that, “They ought to know better
than to tire out an invalid with stopping such
a long time, and as for some of them, why,
they don’t never seem to care how high they
send Mrs. Wilson’s temperature up, with their
worriting talk, and exciting the poor creature
so.”</p>

<p>The nurse would have soon taken the matter
into her own hands, and requested the visitors
to retire when her patient began to look tired,
but that Mrs. Wilson preferred Ella’s attendance
in the room to that of the nurse when
visitors came, and she was not sufficiently
experienced to know when her aunt was beginning
to get tired. The nurse hit upon a
plan, at last, which afforded Ella a good deal
of secret amusement. Mrs. Wilson’s spectacle-case
was always placed on a little table
by the side of her sofa, and the nurse arranged
that, whenever she began to feel a little tired,
and wished to be relieved of her visitors, she
should take up this spectacle-case and lay it
beside her on the sofa, which should be the
signal for Ella, or the nurse, to suggest to the
caller that Mrs. Wilson had talked as much
as was good for her.</p>

<p>Every morning Ella had to bring an account
of all the pets to her aunt, and under her
searching questions revealed an amount of
ignorance that quite appalled the old lady.</p>

<p>“You should not feed the ducks and hens
together,” she said, one day, in answer to a
remark of Ella’s. “Of course, the ducks eat
more than their share, with their great flat
bills. Where are your brains, child?”</p>

<p>Ella had a good deal of trouble with the
fowls’ food at first. Their morning meal was
soft food, consisting of “sharps” (the outer
part of wheat, which is separated in grinding
the corn for white flour) and barley meal,
mixed in equal parts, and added to any kitchen
scraps there might be. This was wetted with
boiling water, and should have been made
into a stiff, dryish paste—a point Mrs. Wilson
had been most particular about. The cook,
however, objected to any extra trouble; as it
was much easier to pour in water enough at
once to make the mixture wet and sloppy, she
always did so; while, as for the kettle really
boiling—well, that was only one of her
mistress’s many fads.</p>

<p>Then there was the Indian meal, which
ought not to have been used, except in the
cold weather, and then only occasionally
mixed with the other meal, but this had all
been used up, and no fresh had been ordered,
so the fowls had been fed on Indian meal
alone, till that, too, was finished.</p>

<p>Again, with her liberal ideas, Ella gave
them far more food than they could eat, and
the wet, sour mess lay about all day; so that
it was not at all to be wondered at that the
fowls drooped, seemed out of order, and did
not lay their proper quantity of eggs, and
Ella, afraid of exciting her aunt by telling her
they were ailing, only increased the evil by
increasing the quantity of food.</p>

<p>This state of things had lasted some time,
when the nurse took pity on Ella’s difficulties,
and told her it would do her aunt no harm to
be asked for advice about the fowls; so, to
Ella’s great relief, they talked the matter over
together, and a change was instituted in the
feeding. Fresh meal of all kinds was ordered,
and Ella had a practical lessons in mixing it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wilson had all the materials brought
into her room, and directed the process, while
Ella, arrayed in a large apron, and with her
sleeves turned up carefully, followed her
instructions.</p>

<p>Some potato peelings and kitchen scraps
had previously been boiled together till they
were quite soft, and now Ella cut these up
small, with an old knife, and then mixed the
meal in equal parts, while waiting for the
kettle to boil.</p>

<p>As soon as it boiled, the scraps were mixed
in with the dry flour, and Ella, seizing the big
wooden spoon, began to stir vigorously, while
the nurse poured in the boiling water.</p>

<p>“Enough water,” Mrs. Wilson cried, in
spite of the incredulity of the two operators,
who had intended to put in twice as much.
“Don’t stop beating it up, child,” and Ella
continued till she was hot and breathless.</p>

<p>“Now take up a handful and squeeze it.”</p>

<p>Ella did so, and it fell from her hand a stiff
lump, leaving her palm quite clean.</p>

<p>“That is quite right,” said Mrs. Wilson,
encouragingly, after slowly arranging her gold
spectacles, and peering at the mass in the
basin. “See that it is always stiff like that;
and never give them more than they will run
after when you throw it for them. If you find
any is left, do not give them so much next
time. At night give them each as much
grain as you can take up in your hand, but no
more. You may give the ducks a little more,
but stop at once when their hunger is not
keen. Now go and feed them, child; I am
tired.”</p>

<p>Under this treatment the fowls soon
revived, and Ella was happy about them
again, at any rate till she discovered that she
had made other mistakes. She found the eggs
she got now were much better and richer than
those bought in shops, or even than those she
got when the fowls were being carelessly fed,
and that in consequence fewer of them were
necessary in cooking.</p>

<p>One day, before she had began to take solid
food, to the great delight of her nurses,
Mrs. Wilson declared she was hungry, and
had taken a fancy for a boiled egg. There
were not many eggs from the hens now, but
the ducks laid regularly; so Ella picked out a
fine large duck egg, and carried in the prettily
arranged tray herself; but what was her
disappointment when, on breaking the shell,
the egg was found not to be fresh. Her aunt
pushed the tray away in disgust, the sight of
the bad egg had quite turned off her appetite,
and she refused to eat anything at all.</p>

<p>The nurse was very much vexed, and Ella
herself was greatly distressed, and went off
with the tray, more convinced than ever that
housekeeping was not her vocation, and that
she never would succeed in it.</p>

<p>The next time she was alone in the sick-room
her aunt told her that she was evidently
very careless about the eggs, and must begin
to manage them differently. To begin with,
she must use up all in the house as quickly as
possible for cooking, and every fresh one that
came in must be dated with lead pencil, and
placed in order, with the large end downward,
in a board pierced with round holes for
the purpose, and which was kept in the cool
larder. They were to be used in the order in
which they were brought in, and, Mrs. Wilson
added, severely, she hoped they would not
soon disgrace themselves again by serving up
a musty egg.</p>

<p>At the beginning of January, Mrs. Wilson
directed Ella to bring a certain note-book and
the writing materials.</p>

<p>“Now,” she began, as soon as Ella was
ready, “you will find a list, at the beginning,
of all subscriptions that are due. I want you
to write to all the people, and enclose the
amounts. I will write cheques for the large
sums, but for the others you must get postal
orders. Make a list of all you will want, and
then you can get them when you go out.”</p>

<p>“But they have not applied for the subscriptions
yet, auntie. I have brought you
every application that has come. Would it
not be better to leave them till they are asked
for?”</p>

<p>But this did not suit Aunt Mary’s views at
all. She pointed out to Ella that she kept a
note herself of the date when her subscriptions
were due, and therefore knew the time as well
as the recipients; and so she did not see the
good of making the charities expend a penny
postage, in addition to the cost of paper and
envelope and clerk’s salary, in merely reminding
her of the fact.</p>

<p>“And be sure,” she continued, “that you
put a stamped envelope in with each subscription.
I want them to get the benefit of the
whole amount, without having to spend part
of it in reminding and thanking me.”</p>

<p>“There is another notice under the ‘January’
heading, auntie, about paying the dog
tax. Ought that to be attended to?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, to be sure. Now you see the
good of keeping a memorandum book, for I
had quite forgotten that January was the
month for renewing the licence. That will be
seven and sixpence. Two dogs, did you say?
Dear, dear, child, how ignorant you are, to be
sure! Don’t you know that dogs are not
taxed till they are six months old, and the
puppy is not nearly that yet?”</p>

<p>Ella looked rather crestfallen at this rebuke,
which her aunt perceiving, hastened to comfort
her by saying—</p>

<p>“Well, it can’t be helped. You are a good
girl, and do your best, my dear; but things
were different when I was young, and girls
were expected to know all the ways of a
house. Ah, yes! girls were very useful, in
the old days, when I was young.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Embrance Clemon</span> sat writing in a snug
room on the second floor of a house in an old-fashioned
London street. A geranium stood
on a flower-stand near the window; the walls
were painted brown, and the carpet had faded
into a comfortable insignificance.</p>

<p>Embrance was just twenty-four. She had
come to London three years ago, on the
strength of a promise of two pupils, and, behold!
the pupils
had
multiplied
rapidly, and
she now had
as many lessons
as she
could manage.
She had been
brought up by an aunt in the
west of England; she had been
educated at a high school, where
she had successfully passed all
the examinations that were open
to her, and she was thoroughly
happy in her present work. In
very truth, she stood alone in
the world. A few months ago,
Mrs. Clemon (the aunt who had
bestowed upon her such good
care) had set sail for New Zealand, to join
her only son, who was a farmer. She would
fain have taken Embrance with her, but there
were two insurmountable difficulties in the
way: a lack of funds, and the young farmer’s
desire to marry his cousin, as soon as
he should be in a position to support a wife.
Embrance liked him, but she did not like him
well enough to consent to this arrangement;
she therefore decided to remain in London,
and Mrs. Clemon, after some fretting, had
been induced to look upon the plan with
approval.</p>

<p>The years of work in the smoke and fog
had not done more than tone down the roses
in Embrance’s cheeks; her hair, simply drawn
back and plaited to her head, was that shade
of brown that most people call black; she had
kindly brown eyes, a large mouth, and a smile
that won the hearts of her pupils at once, and
caused their elder sisters to say that, after all,
Miss Clemon was not so plain when you came
to talk to her. Certainly, Miss Clemon was
very little given to thinking about her appearance.
It was, as Mrs. Clemon had always
maintained, a pity. The grey gown that she
wore, with a stiff collar, was singularly unbecoming
to her; it was, indeed, warm and
scrupulously neat, but when you had said that,
you had come to an end of its praises. It was
hideous.</p>

<p>At last, Embrance put down her pen and
looked at the clock; it was getting late, and
the tea-things were still uncleared from one
end of the table. The street was very quiet,
and she heard the postman’s knock next door.</p>

<p>“I wish somebody would write to me,” she
said, aloud.</p>

<p>It was not the mail day, but there were
friends in the country who corresponded with
her from time to time, and to-night she would
have rejoiced over the arrival of any letter.
“I almost think,” she said, looking round her
little domain with a half-stifled sigh, “that it
was a pity that I refused to go to that concert,
but if I had gone”—with a glance at a
thick book—“I shouldn’t have got through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">{153}</span>
my reading. By-and-by, when I’m an old
lady, perhaps I shall have time to enjoy
myself!” The gratification that she derived
from this reflection was considerably damped
by the after-thought, “and then I shan’t care
about it!”</p>

<p>Her meditations were interrupted at this
stage by a sound of stumbling footsteps on
the staircase. It was Annie, the maid,
panting and out of breath; there was a lady
just come, who wanted to see Miss Clemon.</p>

<p>“A lady!” repeated Embrance. “What is
her name?”</p>

<p>“She didn’t say, miss; she is coming up.”</p>

<p>A sharp ring of a bell sent Annie hurrying
down stairs again; the lady, whoever she
was, would have to find her way unassisted.</p>

<p>Embrance went out on to the landing. “The
stairs are very steep,” she said, “please take
care.”</p>

<p>“Embrance, oh, dear Embrance! is that you
at last?” said a voice from below. “I
thought I should never find you in this
horrible dark place; how can you bear it?”</p>

<p>“Hush! Come up; I am glad to see you,
Joan. Come into my room.”</p>

<p>The new-comer ran up the last few steps,
and flung her arms vehemently round
Embrance, who led her into her sitting-room,
and then drew back to look at her.</p>

<p>“Oh, Embrance,” gasped Joan, fairly
breaking down now that the door was shut
behind her, “do be glad to see me! I have
taken you by surprise, haven’t I? But you
said you would always help me, so I’ve
come.”</p>

<p>She took off her hat, and sat down on the
sofa, dragging Embrance with her. She was
a young, fair girl, graceful in every movement,
with a small, delicate face, surrounded by
masses of yellow hair. Her blue eyes were
full of tears, and her pretty lips quivered.</p>

<p>“My darling,” said Embrance, tenderly,
holding her by both hands, “of course you
came if you wanted me; but you are so tired
and cold, I will ring for some hot water and
make you fresh tea, and when you are rested
you shall tell me all about it.”</p>

<p>“Let me tell you now,” said Joan, excitedly.
“Oh, Embrance! it is so dull at
home now that you are gone, and Mrs. Clemon
is gone, and everybody I care for! And
I don’t get on with my painting, and they
cracked my best plate just when I wanted to
send it to the Exhibition at Exeter.”</p>

<p>“Well, never mind. You must begin
another one,” said Embrance, coaxingly, almost
as if she had been speaking to a child,
while she cut thin slices of bread-and-butter,
and produced cake from the recesses of a cupboard.
“Tell me, is your grandfather in
London?”</p>

<p>“No; he’s at home, and Emily, too. I
said that I should like to come to you, and
they said very well—I must write and ask
you if it would be convenient. And then I
packed a bag, and just came up by the next
train.”</p>

<p>“My dear Joan, they will think that you
are lost.”</p>

<p>“No they won’t. I wrote a letter to
grandpapa before I came away, and he had
given his consent, you know. Are you
shocked, Embrance?”</p>

<p>“Not in the least.” Embrance’s dark eyes
rested on her friend with a look that showed
how completely she meant what she said.
“But I should like to hear the rest of the
story, Joan. There is something more than a
cracked plate.”</p>

<p>“You are a real conjuror. I believe you
know all about it without my telling you.”
Joan hung her head, and went on pathetically,
“Alfred Brownhill has been tiresome again,
and grandpapa is bent upon my accepting
him, and Emily keeps on trying to persuade
me. She says that it is ridiculous for a girl in
my position to throw away such a good
chance. I am tired of being told so often
that I’m dependent; so——”</p>

<p>“You came to me to learn to do for your
self, you poor child! You know how glad I
shall be to help you, if I can.”</p>

<p>“Embrance, you’re the kindest person in
the world!” was all Joan said; but she slipped
her hand into her friend’s slim fingers caressingly.</p>

<p>They had been friends from childhood.
Embrance had often helped little Joan Fulloch
with her lessons, or coaxed her grandfather
into overlooking some escapade that
was against his notions of propriety. She
knew well that it was a dreary home for an
imaginative girl down at Doveton, and that
Emily (another granddaughter of the old
man’s) was as unsympathetic as she could be,
looking upon Joan’s wish to become an artist
as the wildest of wild schemes. Embrance
had vague recollections of Mr. Brownhill (a
flourishing county town solicitor) as a dull
man, who played lawn tennis. She did not
believe that Joan liked him, and as the child
was harshly treated at home, she was doubly
welcome here. At any rate, if the worst
came to the worst, there was a small sum in
the savings bank that would pay extra
expenses for a year to come—and a year
was a long time to look forward in Embrance’s
eyes.</p>

<p>Joan soon regained her spirits, and forgot
her fatigue in the novelty of the situation. It
was like a fairy tale, living up here at the top
of that corkscrew staircase; and what a pretty
flower! and might she paint here when
Embrance was out? She had her own
notions, though they were somewhat erratic,
about making money.</p>

<p>To-morrow she would write to her cousin,
Horace Meade, and he would help her to get
something to do; and she began making
calculations as to the number of people who
required dinner services in the course of a
year. If Horace could once get orders for her,
her fortune was made, and in her spare time,
she would paint landscapes for exhibitions.
“Then, you must give up these rooms,”
exclaimed Joan, eagerly, “and we can go and
live somewhere where there is a garden. And,
dear Embrance, you’ll let me buy you
another dress. You ought really never to
wear that cold colour.”</p>

<p>Joan’s own dress was of a delicate blue
shade, hanging in artistic folds about her
pretty figure.</p>

<p>Embrance heaved a little sigh; she was
accustomed of old to her friend’s castle-building,
but she would not say a word to
damp her ardour on this first night. She
arranged her books and papers ready for the
morning’s work (her special reading must, of
course, be put aside now), then she came and
sat by Joan, and listened to her long account
of home troubles, till the clock struck eleven, and
the lamp began to burn low.</p>

<p>The days passed on; the winter was at
hand. In spite of Joan Fulloch’s good
resolutions, in spite of her hostess’s kindness,
she was far from content in her new surroundings.
Her grandfather had sent a box containing
clothes and painting materials; he had
enclosed a brief note in which he foretold that
she would soon wish to return to Doveton.
Perhaps, if it had not been for this note,
Joan would have said good-bye to Embrance
and the second floor parlour some weeks ago.
As it was she stayed on, always looking out
for commissions that never came, and making
plans to paint pictures that she never began.
Either the light was too bad, or she had a
headache; there was always an excuse, and
Embrance returned night after night, to find
her visitor plunged in the depths of despair.
She would straightway set to work to cheer
her up, and before tea was over, Joan was
invariably sure of success—to-morrow or the
next day. At last she heard of a pupil, but,
unfortunately, she did not take kindly to
teaching; she was very unpunctual, and it did
not seem likely that her connection would
increase with rapidity. In the meantime,
Embrance had begun to draw upon her
savings, for the expenses had increased
marvellously since the autumn. There were so
many little luxuries that Joan, poor child,
could not possibly do without.</p>

<p>“Embrance,” said Joan, one evening. She
was sitting over the fire with a novel, her face
was flushed, and her hair was disordered; “I
do want so many things. I wish I could earn
some money.”</p>

<p>“You have got your pupil,” said Embrance,
looking up from her book. She was
translating Schiller, and it was the third time
that Joan had interrupted her.</p>

<p>“Five shillings an hour!” exclaimed Joan,
kicking the fireirons down with a clatter.
“It’s so little; I shan’t have earned enough
by Christmas to buy a winter jacket, and
besides, I owe you so much, Embrance!”</p>

<p>“Never mind about that, Joanie; I have
enough for the present, if we are careful.”</p>

<p>“It is so tiresome of Horace to be away
just when I want him most,” continued Joan,
“but he’ll come to-morrow; he has enough
to do; he ought to be able to help me. Do
try and be in early to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Embrance shook her head. “I can’t be
home till seven o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Put off that stupid lesson.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it is impossible.”</p>

<p>“I want you to see Horace. You never do
anything I ask you!”</p>

<p>“I am very sorry, Joan.”</p>

<p>“What’s the good of being sorry?” asked
Joan, pettishly. “No, no! I don’t mean it!”
She turned round sharply and saw that her
friend’s eyes were full of tears. In a second,
she had flung down her book and was kneeling
at Embrance’s chair: “Do forgive me, it isn’t
true. You are the only person in the world
who has real patience with me. Don’t mind
what I said; I didn’t mean it.”</p>

<p>It took some time to calm Joan down after
her fit of penitence, but at last she went back
to her novel.</p>

<p>Embrance sat with both arms on the table;
the translation got no farther. Her heart was
full of love for her friend, and yet—she had
her fair share of common sense—she could
not but see that Joan was thoroughly unfit for
her present mode of life. She was just one of
those girls who would be happiest in a home
of her own. Here, for once, Embrance found
herself cordially agreeing with Emily Fulloch,
who was as old-fashioned in her notions as it
was possible for a narrow-minded spinster to
be.</p>

<p>Perhaps a “brain-wave” of sympathy
passed from one friend to another at that
moment, for Joan looked up from her book:</p>

<p>“Darling, I think you will like Horace
better than Mr. Brownhill, though he is not so
good-looking. I hope you will!”</p>

<p>“I will try,” said Embrance, jumping up to
kiss Joan; “I will try my hardest, for your
sake.”</p>

<p>Joan blushed, and Embrance began talking
of other matters.</p>

<p>A week later, Mrs. Rakely (a friend of the
Fullochs) came to London. She stayed at an
hotel close by, and was glad of Joan’s
company, as she wished to get through as
much sight-seeing as she conveniently—or
inconveniently—could in the space of a fortnight.</p>

<p>One Saturday afternoon Embrance had
come home early (Joan had gone to luncheon
with Mrs. Rakely); she was tired, it had been
a warm, rainy day; her boots were muddy
and her dress was damp. The armchair by the
fire looked very tempting; she sat down, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">{154}</span>
in a few seconds was fast asleep, dreaming of
a magnificent abode in New Zealand, where
Joan, in a white satin gown and a diamond
necklace, was blissfully wedded to an
emperor with flowing ringlets and bright
grey eyes. The emperor had very bright eyes,
indeed, and a habit of knocking on the ground
with his sceptre; he was also afflicted with a
curious kind of cough that did not sound
natural—and yet it was natural, appallingly so.
With a start and a jerk, Embrance sat up
in her chair wide awake, and met the gaze of
a real pair of grey eyes (brimming over with
fun) that belonged to a gentleman, who stood,
hat in hand, at the open door.</p>

<p>“I really apologise humbly,” he said, without
venturing to approach; “but I was told
to walk up, and I knocked several times, and
someone said ‘Come in.’”</p>

<p>Embrance had recovered her presence of
mind. “Please do come in,” she said. “I
am very sorry that I was asleep; but I was
so tired. I think you are Mr. Meade?”</p>

<p>“That is my name,” said the visitor, looking
across the room from the smoky fire to the rows
of books with a quick glance; “and I have
the pleasure of speaking to Miss Clemon.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Embrance, holding out her
hand. “Joan will be so disappointed to miss
you. She is not in.”</p>

<p>The recollection of her plans for Joan’s
future happiness brought the blood to her
cheeks. She stooped over the fire to hide
her confusion. Yes, she liked the look of
him. He had a clever, kindly face, much
bronzed by the sun; he wore a short beard
and a turned-down collar; he had no gloves,
and his hands were long and thin.</p>

<p>“Do let me do that for you,” said Mr.
Meade, putting down his hat and umbrella.
“I am exceedingly skilful at managing fires
and chimneys; in fact, I have occasionally
regretted not having been brought up to it
professionally.”</p>

<p>“As a chimney-sweep?” inquired Embrance.</p>

<p>“No, I think not,” said Mr. Meade, gravely,
as he inserted the poker between the bars,
“but there might have been an opening as
stoker or master of the bellows in some grand
family. There, now, if you will allow me to
have a sheet of newspaper, I think I shall
succeed to perfection.”</p>

<p>Embrance fetched the newspaper, and in a
few minutes the crimson flames were leaping
up the chimney.</p>

</div>
<p class="ph3">A PASTORALE.</p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">By</span> DARLEY DALE, Author of “Fair Katherine,” etc.</p>


<h3>CHAPTER IX.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following Saturday turned out to be
a misty November morning. Towards
noon the fog lifted, and at half-past one,
when Dame Hursey prepared to start to
keep her appointment with her son, it was
tolerably clear, but the old wool-gatherer,
who was as weather-wise as John Shelley
himself, shook her head as she scanned
the horizon from the door of her miserable
cottage, and muttered to herself she
doubted the fog would come on worse
than ever at sunset.</p>

<p>As this was the first time she had seen
her son for twelve or thirteen years, and
would probably be the last, seeing that
he was going back to Australia, probably
never to return, at least in her lifetime,
Dame Hursey regarded the occasion as
a festive one, and had taken a holiday
in honour of it. Her morning had been
spent in cleaning her miserable cottage,
in the faint hope that her son might be
persuaded to come home and spend the
evening with her. In this hope all her
wool-gatherings had been taken upstairs
instead of lying about the floor and
corners of the kitchen, as they usually
did; the floor had been scrubbed, a fire
was lighted, two rickety armchairs drawn
up to it, and a cup and saucer, a mug,
and two or three plates—Dame Hursey’s
stock of crockery—placed on the table.
She dispensed with dinner, and contenting
herself with a piece of bread and
cheese, reserved two red herrings for her
tea on her return with her son.</p>

<p>Then she dressed herself in her Sunday
dress, not without some qualms lest
the fog should turn to rain. Even if it
did, on such an occasion as this she
must wear her best things, so she put
on her black stuff dress, a black and
white plaid shawl, and a bonnet that
might have come out of the ark, judging
from its antique shape, and which, to
Dame Hursey’s pride, was ornamented
with some dirty old artificial flowers.
Thus attired, and having made up the
fire and left the kettle on the hob, she
locked up her hut, put the key in her
pocket, and providing herself with a
gigantic cotton umbrella, to answer the
purpose of a walking-stick as well as in
case of rain, she set out for Mount
Harry.</p>

<p>Though Dame Hursey knew all the
short cuts, it was more than an hour’s
walk from her house to the top of Mount
Harry, but the old woman was longing
to see her son again, so she started in
good time, and reached the spot a
quarter of an hour before he did, though
he was punctual. The fog was rolling
up again, as the old wool-gatherer had
predicted, and, accustomed as her black
eyes were to piercing the mists which
so often wrap those rounded hills like a
damp clinging garment, her son was
close upon her before she saw his form,
looming like a gigantic grey figure close
beside her. It was twelve years and a
half since they had met, and George
Hursey was very much altered in appearance
since, in the character of John
Smith, carpenter on board the French
yacht Hirondelle, he had laid the
baron’s little daughter on John Shelley’s
doorstep; but for all that his mother declared
she would have recognised him
in a crowd.</p>

<p>“You’ll come home and have a cup
of tea and a chat, George, after all these
years, won’t you?” said the old dame,
gazing with pride and affection on her
ne’er-do-well son.</p>

<p>“No, mother, no; I might be recognised,
and I don’t want to be arrested
for making off with a child, before I go
back to my own wife and children.”</p>

<p>“The child is safe enough, if you mean
the child you left on John Shelley’s
doorstep thirteen years ago come next
June.”</p>

<p>George Hursey gave a sigh of relief,
for many a nightmare had that innocent
baby, which, for aught he knew to the
contrary, might have perished from cold
or exposure through his fault, given him.</p>

<p>“John Shelley took it in then, as I
thought he would?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and a beauty she is, and no
mistake. George, tell me who the child
is, will you, honey?” said Dame Hursey,
in a wheedling tone.</p>

<p>“That’s what I have come here for
chiefly, that and to see you once again,
for when I say good-bye to England to-morrow
it will be for good this time; I
am going to give up the sea, and live at
home now.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know your own affairs
best; but about the lassie, George;
whose child is she? No poor person’s,
I’ll be bound,” said Dame Hursey,
whose curiosity about Fairy exceeded
even her interest in her son’s family
affairs.</p>

<p>“She is the niece of my late master,
a French gentleman, and it was by his
wish I took her to John Shelley, only instead
of going in as I pretended I had
done, I left her on the doorstep, and
went off with the purse; and if
ever I cursed in my life I have cursed
that money, which, for aught I knew till
a few minutes ago, had made me a murderer,
though for that matter I may be
one still, for the baroness may have
fretted herself into her grave for her
baby.”</p>

<p>“The baroness, did you say, George?
Sure, I was right, she is no common
child, no fit wife even for gentleman
Jack,” exclaimed the old woman, opening
her umbrella, partly to keep the fog
off, partly as a sort of screen to shut in the
secret she had yearned so long to learn.
But George was following up his own
train of thought, and went on, heedless
of her interruption—</p>

<p>“Though, as true as I stand here, I
never knew till last week that Monsieur
Léon was drowned, and the Hirondelle
lost a day or two after I left her. Likely
as not the baron thinks the child was
drowned too, since they have never found
her. I might never have known, only
I happened to ask at Yarmouth if they
had ever had a French yacht named
Hirondelle over there, and some of the
fishermen remembered all about the
wreck. When I heard that I determined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">{155}</span>
to come and see if the child was safe, and
now I know it is, I want to do the rest,
mother.”</p>

<p>“Yes, honey, what is it? You may
trust me. I guessed the night I met you
you knew all about the fairies’ child, and
I have kept your secret and watched the
child ever since, for your sake, George.”</p>

<p>“Well, I want you to go to John
Shelley, or to the parson if you like, or
both, and tell them the child belongs to
the Baron de Thorens, of Château de
Thorens, near Carolles, in Normandy.
Shall I write it down for you?”</p>

<p>“No, no, I can’t read it if you do; I
shall remember fast enough—Baron de
Thorens, Château de Thorens, near
Carolles, Normandy. I shall think of
Christmas carols, De Thorens, Château
de Thorens,” repeated Dame Hursey.</p>

<p>“Never mind château, it only means
castle, but don’t forget the name, De
Thorens. Here, I’ll cut that word on
your umbrella handle with my knife in
printed letters. You can read print, I
know.”</p>

<p>“All right; and what else am I to
tell them?”</p>

<p>“Why, that my master and the baron
gave me the child twelve years and a
half ago to put out to nurse with an
Englishwoman. I went ashore at
Brighton in a little boat with Pierre
Legros, one of the sailors, and I walked
across the downs with the child, and
left it on John Shelley’s doorstep; then
I told Monsieur Léon John had taken
it in and promised to look after it. He
took the address, and the only person I
thought I had robbed was John Shelley,
though I knew the baron would make it
up to him when he heard of it.”</p>

<p>“Are they rich, George?” asked the
old woman, taking a pinch of snuff as
she peered at her son through the fog.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so. The château is a
beautiful place, and stands in a park.”</p>

<p>“Is that all I am to say?”</p>

<p>“Yes, leave the rest to the parson to
decide; he will write to the baron in
French very likely. You may tell them
as soon as you like, for I shall be out
of the country to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I shall wait till you are gone; one
day more can’t make any difference,
and it is best to be on the safe side, then
if they want to know where you are, I
can say on your way to Australia, so
there’ll be no fear of their catching you,
though it is so long ago there isn’t much
danger of that now.”</p>

<p>“Please yourself, and now I must be
off. Here are five sovereigns for you,
mother; they are honestly earned, so
you need not be afraid to take them, and
now I must say good-bye. How thick
the fog is; there is no danger of anyone
seeing me this evening; it is as much as
I shall do to find my way down to the
Brighton Road without breaking my
neck in a chalk pie. Take care of yourself,
mother; but you know these downs
better than I do,” said George Hursey,
kissing his mother.</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, lad, never fear for me; I
have been out in worse fogs than this.
Good-bye, God bless you,” and the old
wool-gatherer strained her eyes till her
son’s figure disappeared, as it very
quickly did, in the fog.</p>

<p>She stood still for a minute or two
after he had gone, gloating over the
secret she had at last discovered, and
muttering to herself again and again,
“Baron de Thorens, Carolles, Normandy,”
and then she too turned and
walked slowly off through the fog in a
different direction.</p>

<p>It was quite true she had been out in
worse fogs than this, but whether it was
that she was too much occupied with
her own thoughts to think of where she
was going, or whether the fog, which
gradually increased, was worse than
she fancied, she suddenly, after wandering
about for half-an-hour, awoke to the
conclusion that she did not know where
she was. If she had come right she
ought to have been at the bottom of
the hill by now, whereas she was still
on flat ground, and had not begun the
descent.</p>

<p>She had been so absorbed in wondering
what the Shelleys, particularly
“gentleman Jack,” as she always called
Jack, would say to her news, and in
picturing to herself the amazement on
learning that Fairy was the daughter of
a French nobleman, perhaps a baroness
herself or a countess, for Dame Hursey
had very vague ideas on the subject of
French titles; and in thinking how
pleased Fairy would be to hear she was
a rich lady, that she forgot all about
the fog and where she was going. Loving
gossip as she did, the secret George
had put in her power was dearer to her
than the five sovereigns tied up in the
corner of her pocket-handkerchief; it
would add to her importance in the
neighbourhood more than the gold.
Moreover, it might lead to a reward for
her, since she had had no part in leaving
the child to the care of the shepherd,
and Fairy she was sure would not suffer
her to be forgotten when the Shelleys
came to be rewarded.</p>

<p>“Why, but for me Fairy might never
find her parents after all; if I were to
keep this secret to myself she would
never know for certain she was a lady
born, perhaps a countess. I shall make
them understand that before I tell them.
Or, if anything was to happen to me now
before I have told them, why they’d like
to never know it. Bless me, where am
I? This fog is worse than I thought;
I ought to have been home by now, and
here I am still on the top. De Thorens,
Carolles, Normandy,” and so muttering
to herself Dame Hursey disappeared in
the fog.</p>

<p>That same afternoon, Fairy, little thinking
her name and birth were so soon to
be revealed, and her happy life in the
shepherd’s cottage exchanged for a very
different one in a French château, had
gone for a walk with Charlie, and, to
Mrs. Shelley’s great anxiety, at half-past
five o’clock, when her husband and Jack
came in to tea, they were not home. The
fog now was so dense that you could
hardly see your hand before you, and
even with a lantern you could not
discern anything a yard or two in
advance of you, and Mrs. Shelley was
intensely relieved when John and Jack
came home safe.</p>

<p>“Thank God you are both back safely;
it is an awful fog, isn’t it, John?” asked
Mrs. Shelley, as John stood wiping
the fog from his beard and face.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is a bad one; luckily both Jack
and I saw it was coming on and got the
sheep home before dark, or we might
have been half the night on the downs.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it tiresome? Charlie and Fairy
went out for a walk soon after dinner,
and they are not back now; I have been
in such a fright about them,” said Mrs.
Shelley.</p>

<p>“What, mother? Fairy out in this
fog? Good heavens! the child may be
killed! What on earth does that little
idiot mean by taking her out in a fog?
He deserves a sound thrashing,” burst
out Jack.</p>

<p>“Hush, Jack; Charlie may be in
danger as well,” said Mrs. Shelley.</p>

<p>“Serve him right too,” muttered Jack,
as he went in search of a lantern without
another word.</p>

<p>“Fairy and Charlie out, wife? Dear
me, we shall have to go and look for
them; why, they may fall into a chalkpit
and break their necks. Where have
they gone?” asked John, leisurely
putting on his hat and scarf.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but I fancy to Mount
Harry; I heard Fairy talking about it.”</p>

<p>“Here, Jack, we shall have to go and
look for them children, I think,” called
out the shepherd to Jack.</p>

<p>“Of course we shall; I am lighting
the lantern; let’s be off at once,
father,” said Jack, who had made the
necessary preparations for the search
while his father was taking in the fact
that the children were lost, and now
stood with the lantern in his hand and
his dog by his side at the open door.</p>

<p>“Where are we to go, father?” said
Jack as they started.</p>

<p>“Well, your mother says they are
gone to Mount Harry, so if we were to
go along the Oatham-road and search
those chalkpits as we go, that is the
only place they are likely to have fallen
down. If they are not there, and God
forbid they should be, we shall know
they have not come to much harm
beyond a fright. When we have passed
the chalkpits we can climb up Mount
Harry and come back by the jail; I
have my compass, we can’t go far wrong
with that.”</p>

<p>Jack fell in with this plan at once; it
was by far the best thing they could
do; but then John Shelley, in his slow,
methodical way, invariably hit upon the
wisest plan of action in an emergency,
as Jack very well knew. Accordingly,
off they started, each with a lantern and
the shepherd’s dog leading the way.
Jack’s own dog was younger and not so
steady as Rover, so he kept him at
home. This Rover was a son of the
Rover who had first discovered the
fairies’ baby on his master’s doorstep
that midsummer evening, but John
Shelley called all his dogs Rover, and
was rather scandalised when Jack
insisted on naming his dog Bruce; it
was an innovation, and the shepherd
disliked anything new; however, in this
he was persuaded to yield, Mrs. Shelley
and Fairy taking Jack’s part, and saying
two Rovers in one family at the same
time would never do.</p>

ITALY.</h2>
</div>
<p class="ph3"><span class="smcap">By</span> TWO LONDON BACHELORS.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">After</span> leaving Lugano, the train enters
two tunnels, shortly after which it crosses
the Lake at Bissone, by means of a most
hideous stone bridge. Bissone is a very
picturesque village. The little steeple of
the church rises romantically from the
luxuriant foliage, and numerous cottages are
scattered on the side of the lake. The charm
of the scene, however, is much marred by the
aforementioned bridge.</p>

<p>After leaving Bissone, the train goes directly
south to Mendrisio, the station for Monte
Generoso, the view from which is said to be
equal (if not superior) to that from the Rigi.
We had intended to climb Monte Generoso,
but it being a very misty day, there would, of
course, have been no view, so we continued
our journey, passing Chiasso and Como. At
Chiasso the luggage is examined, for, strange
to say, one is in Swiss territory until arriving
at Como.</p>

<p>We did not stay at Como, as we had decided
to see that city and its beautiful lake on
our return journey. The route from Como to
Milan interested us, from the variety it afforded
to the mountainous districts we had recently
visited. There is, indeed, a great charm in
the dead level of this huge Lombard plain;
for apart from its cities, so interesting,
historically and archæologically, we felt a
certain sense of relief in getting again into a
flat country, luxuriantly fertile and productive.</p>

<p>We made a mistake in not staying at
Monza, a very ancient city containing, amongst
other interesting buildings, a cathedral,
founded by Queen Teodolinda in the sixth
century, and a Broletto, or town hall,
attributed to Frederic Barbarossa. We
arrived at Milan early in the afternoon, and
immediately drove to our hotel, through one
of the magnificent gates which guard the approaches
to the city.</p>

<p>On entering this, the first great Italian city
which we had seen, many thoughts crowded
into our minds. Here we were in a country
the very cradle of European art, where
through all times, even down to the present,
art seems a vital necessity to the people. In
other lands art has been an ornament or a
luxury, but in Italy it seems to enter into the
very life of the inhabitants, and nothing seems to
have been able to wean them from their
devotion to the beautiful creations of the
hand of man. We find them revelling in art
when foreign armies were overunning the
country and decimating the population. We
find it under tyranny and oppression of the
most galling description—surrounded by acts
of horror and infamy of the most despicable
kind. We find it often in combination with
ignorance and folly that are simply contemptible.
We find it existing when liberty was
utterly suppressed. Thus during all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">{158}</span>
Middle Ages and the period of the Renaissance,
whether the Italians were slaves or free,
whether they were conquered or victorious,
whether they were united or divided, still this
marvellous spirit of art seems to have pervaded
everything from their religion down to the
most ordinary acts of everyday life.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p class="center">INTERIOR OF MILAN CATHEDRAL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Another thought which naturally suggests
itself on entering Milan is that of the two
noble characters whose lives stand out like
brilliant meteors amongst the gloom, horror,
wickedness, and folly, which stain so much of
her history. We refer to her two Archbishops—St.
Ambrose, the light and glory of
her early history; and Charles Borromeo, the
bright star which illumined her deepest
gloom. And one cannot help thinking of the
good and great man pursuing his mission of
charity amongst the sick and dying of the
plague-stricken city.</p>

<p>Our first thought was to find our way
to the cathedral, the second largest Gothic
church in Europe, about which probably
more has been written, and a greater
number of conflicting opinions as to its
merit expressed, than about any building in
the world, with the exception of St. Peter’s,
Rome. As it is impossible to say anything
new about this wonderful cathedral, we shall
principally confine our remarks to our own
individual impressions and opinions.</p>

<p>To commence with, the first view of the
interior struck us as far finer than the more
popular exterior. Indeed, so great an effect
had it upon No. 2, that he turned as white as
a sheet, and seemed completely overcome
with the wonder of the buildings. The
enormous proportions of the church, the great
height of the pillars, with their canopied niches
over the capitals, and the rich religious effect
of the whole, formed a picture, in comparison
to which (in our eyes) the blazing but
meretricious glory of the exterior, with its
4,000 or so niches and vast masses of carving,
was not to be compared. It is said that an
intimate acquaintance with both exterior and
interior will fall far short of one’s first
impressions.</p>

<p>Now this did not strike us with regard to
the interior. No, not even after we realised
the tracery of the roof to be painted, and the
tracery of the windows to be somewhat
straggling and unmeaning. But it is a
different matter from the exterior; after the
first astonishment is over, one sees at once
the great over-elaboration and the general
“spikiness” of the effect, though No. 1
thought the admixture of the Renaissance style
in the façade saved this portion of the
cathedral by supplying that solidity and
“sobriety of line” which the building otherwise
so painfully lacks.</p>

<p>Even before we heard that the architect was
supposed to have been a German, we recognised
the Teutonic character of the cathedral,
especially of the interior, which seemed to be
not entirely unlike that of Cologne.</p>

<p>To enter more into detail, the plan is a
Latin Cross, terminated by an apse, and
divided into a nave and four aisles. The
interior is 477 feet in length, by 183 in
breadth, exclusive of the transepts, and is
supported by fifty-two pillars, which are eighty
feet in height and twelve feet in diameter.
The before-mentioned niches, which crown
the pillars, are a great feature, each niche
being of different design, and all remarkably
beautiful. The roof is elaborately painted in
imitation (so it is said) of tracery. Street
calls this an “abominable device, which never
ceases to offend and annoy the eye more and
more every time it is observed.” The effect
did not seem to No. 1 at all disagreeable; quite
the contrary. He thought it added great
beauty and richness to the design, and does
not believe that it was ever intended to deceive
the beholder into the idea that it is
real tracery. “Why not believe it to be
mere decorative painting, and beautiful art as
such?” he asked. But No. 2 was really
deceived into believing that the imitation of
tracery was actually what it represented,
particularly as the design, which is in dark-brown
colouring upon a light ceiling, represents
carvings of beautiful patterns and filigree
work, very much like the Gothic screens of some
of our English cathedrals, only fixed upon the
ceiling instead of being on the line of sight. But
when, after investigation, he found the paint
obliterated here and there by damp and other
causes, showing blotches of brown and white,
he was disgusted beyond measure, and began
to look upon other work with suspicion.
“Why,” cried he, “should a Christian church
impose on the unwary, or to the wary
preach affectation and artifice?”</p>

<p>There is no triforium, and the pavement is
a mosaic of various coloured marbles. There is
a great quantity of old stained glass in the
windows, which, though not equal to our old
English glass, yet gives the building a very religious
effect, which is still more enhanced by
the colour of the stonework, which has the appearance
of old ivory. The interior is well
filled with ancient monuments; but we have
no space to describe them, and will simply
add that the most remarkable are those of
Gian Giacomo and Gabriele de Medici, attributed
to Michael Angelo; of Cardinal Caracciolo,
in black marble, by Bambaja; and of
Ottone Visconti, Archbishop of Milan, which
is earlier in date than any portion of the
cathedral. In the north transept is the bronze
candelabrum for holding seven lamps, constructed
in imitation of that which existed
in the Holy Temple of Jerusalem—a magnificent
work erected in the thirteenth century.
And in the south transept is a famous statue
of St. Bartholomew being flayed alive.</p>

<p>St. Charles Borromeo, the great Archbishop
of Milan, is buried below the dome in a subterranean
chapel. It may interest our girls to
know that he was the originator of Sunday-schools
in Europe.</p>

<p>The Duomo of Milan is like no other
building in the world, it belongs to no distinct
style of architecture, and in art it had neither
parents nor children. Nothing was ever built
like it before, and nothing will ever be built
like it again. We do not say that it is the
most beautiful church ever built, nor do
we deny that, architecturally speaking, it
possesses many grave faults, but what we
mean is this: Of all other churches we say
they are built in such and such a style, or are
of such and such an order of architecture.
But of this we say simply, it is the Duomo of
Milan.</p>

<p>When this vast structure, with its countless
pinnacles of pure white marble glittering in the
sun, and backed-up by a dark blue sky, breaks
upon our astonished gaze, the mind is
absorbed with wonder.</p>

<p>Is it a vision? What have we seen before
like it—possibly only one thing—the snow-clad
peaks of the Alps. One cannot get rid of the
notion that some kind of relationship exists
between the two. We begin almost to suspect
that some mighty Alp, with its snow-clad
peaks, must have been its mother—so much is
it like the kind of architecture that would have
sprung from the mountains.</p>

<p>It was after leaving the Duomo that the
two bachelors had their first quarrel. This is
how it came about:—The older bachelor, who
is impressionable and of a poetical and non-technical
turn of mind, enjoys an undisturbed
first sight of a magnificent building, without
first of all inquiring into its structural and
architectural details; and if there is one thing
more than another which annoys him, it is to
have the “dry bones” of workmanship dinned
into his ears and thrust before his mental
vision when the complete building should
rather impress on him all that it has to say of
great achievement and power.</p>

<p>Now the younger bachelor is technical and
fond of dates, so seized the opportunity of showing
off his knowledge of history and archæology
at the very moment when his friend was first
gazing at the religious splendour of the interior
of the cathedral. This made No. 2 insist on
a judicial separation, at any rate for the first
hour, so the greater part of the building was
explored in “single blessedness.” The quarrel,
postponed, of course, until we had left the
Duomo, was happily of short duration, and
the two bachelors compared notes, and came
to the conclusion that, after all, more permanent
unity is created by contradictory temperaments.
Whether this would apply in the
case of man and wife they unfortunately could
offer no opinion founded on experience, so they
wended their way through some very narrow,
uninteresting streets to the church of St.
Ambrose, at the west of the city.</p>

<p>St. Ambrogio, founded in the fourth century,
is full of ancient epitaphs and early Christian
antiquities, notwithstanding that it was very
much repaired in the seventeenth century.
The walls of the “atrium,” or open court, in
front of it, contain fragments of frescoes,
ancient inscriptions, etc., which, backed up
by the Romanesque red brick church (dating
from the ninth century), form one of the most
picturesque scenes in North Italy.</p>

<p>The interior of St. Ambrogio is, if possible,
more interesting than the exterior; it is of
grey stone, with arches of red brick, a quaint
effect of colour. There are no transepts, and
the building terminates in an apse.</p>

<p>It would take pages to describe all that is
remarkable in the interior of St. Ambrogio, so
we shall only mention some of the interesting
features. On first entering the nave we
noticed two pillars, on one of which is a brazen
serpent, said to be the brazen serpent of
Exodus. The vaulting of the apse is very
ancient, and is covered with mosaic work as
fine as anything in St. Mark’s, Venice. Below
we noticed the old chair of St. Ambrose.
The high altar is interesting, as being the
place where some of the German emperors
received the iron crown of Lombardy; a baldachino
or ciborium covers it.</p>

<p>On the front of the high altar (itself a
blaze of glory) are depicted scenes from the
life of Christ, while on the back are represented
incidents in the life of St. Ambrose,
the former in plates of gold and the latter
silver-gilt.</p>

<p>St. Ambrogio contains several frescoes.
The finest are “Legend of St. George,”
by Bernardino; and “Ecce Homo,” by
Luini. In it also are the shrines of Saints
Gervasius and Protasius—very popular saints
in Italy.</p>

<p>On leaving St. Ambrogio we wished to get
straight back to our hotel; but we unfortunately
lost our way, and were obliged to ask
an Italian gentleman to direct us. He not
only put us on the right road, but actually
went out of his way to ensure our not losing
ourselves again. This is characteristic of the
North Italians. They are really polite, and,
according to the elder bachelor, the most gentlemanly
people he has visited.</p>

<p>After <i>table d’hôte</i> we strolled out of the
hotel, and walked through the magnificent Galleria
Vittorio Emmanuel (containing some
of the best shops in Milan) into the Piazza
del Duomo. It was a beautiful moonlight
night, and the cathedral looked simply glorious—its
dazzling whiteness almost frightening us
as it suddenly burst on our view. After due
deliberation No. 2 irreverently said that the
appearance was similar to that of a colossal wedding-cake,
with its sugary-looking ornamentations
under a strong light. The Duomo, though
not a very pure example of Gothic, possibly
over-ornamented, and its detail not always in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">{159}</span>
the best taste, is certainly one of the most
extraordinary examples of man’s industry,
perseverance, and wealth to be found in the
whole realm of art.</p>

<p>It was about 9 o’clock p.m. that the first
scene was enacted of what might have
completely wrecked our holiday, viz., the
longing of the younger bachelor to smoke
one of the long cigars, with straws in
them at either end, which foreigners, especially
Italians, seem so to enjoy. No. 2 (the
older) bachelor being the better linguist, went
into a tobacco shop and ordered one of these
cigars. It was in vain that the shopman declared
they were never bought by English;
it was of no use his repeating that they were
so inferior—No, No. 1 had set his heart on
possessing one of them, and have one he
would.</p>

<p>We bought two, one of which the
younger bachelor immediately smoked, having
first carefully extracted the straws. The other
was given to the waiter, and it is safe to predict
that neither of us will ever be seen with
one of those terrible cigars again. About
10 p.m. No. 1 began to show signs of a violent
bilious attack, which grew worse as the night
came on. This was the commencement of an
ailment which afterwards turned out to be
“gastric fever.” There was little sleep that
night for either of the bachelors, as No. 2
sat up by his friend during a great part of the
night. The next morning, however, though
still unwell, No. 1 insisted on going to church.
On returning hotel-ward the younger felt
alarmingly ill, and could not walk further
without help.</p>

<p>When we got to the hotel, No. 2 determined
to send for a doctor, and, looking into his
Baedeker, chose one of those recommended.
Our girls must not think it was entirely the
horrible cigar that made No. 1 so ill.
They must remember he was described as
having a shocking digestion, which had been
“upset” by the continual travelling and the
change of food; also, the sudden change from
the bracing mountain air to the comparatively
enervating climate of Milan, no doubt accelerated
the illness. The doctor came about four
hours after he was sent for, and, after asking
innumerable questions as to the occupation,
rule of life, etc., of the bachelor, seemingly
unnecessary—not to say impertinent—prescribed
an alarming amount of medicine. We
shall remember that doctor, with his important
manner and soft, deep voice. He was a
smart, healthy-looking man, with an imposing
moustache and short black hair. We shall also
remember the answer he gave to the older
bachelor, who had inquired how long it would
be before his friend would be well enough to
resume his travels—“Maybe in two or three
weeks,” being the encouraging reply.</p>

<p>The younger bachelor is here reminded of
the interesting view of chimney-pots and
house-roof visible from his bedroom window,
which it was his fate to watch incessantly for
two whole days, miserably ill, with one longing
in life, viz., to quench his burning thirst with
“a lemon squash.”</p>

<p>As it seemed the less expensive method,
No. 2 shopped for the lemons, bringing in a
dozen at a time, and squeezing them with his
fingers into a water-bottle glass. The sugar
was purloined from the <i>salle-à-manger</i> (as we
wish this narrative of ours to be a strictly
truthful one, we resolutely admit our guilt,
but hope the Italian Government will not be
too hard on us), for we preferred the charge of
one halfpenny per “squash,” instead of one
franc, the probable price of one bought at the
hotel. If any one of our readers has had a
brother to supply incessantly with “lemon
squash” for two days and one night, without
the use of a proper lemon-squeezer, she will
appreciate the sad intelligence that No. 2’s
finger joints are now less supple and powerful
than before this Italian tour.</p>

<p><i>La femme de chambre</i> was, as most young
women are to forlorn and helpless bachelors,
tender and kind. In fact, at the end of two
days she quietly suggested that a lemon squash
was the worst drink for the poor patient, and
actually the dear thing made for him some
oatmeal, bringing into the room a sieve, a
basin, some warm water, and a screw of paper
containing oatmeal. Then (<i>à la</i> Useful Hints
in the G. O. P.) the recipe was as follows:—A
little oatmeal in the strainer, hold over the
empty basin, and with the warm water (by
this time very lukewarm), percolate through
the sieve, and behold a dish of Scotch oatmeal!</p>

<p>That preparation did not seem to improve
the condition of the poor patient.</p>

<p>“Oh, that we had some English lady with
us,” cried No. 2.</p>

<p>“Never no more,” groaned No. 1, with his
face to the wall, though whether this depressing
remark had a reference to the oatmeal,
the gentler sex, or the “holiday” (save the
mark!), No. 2 has not yet been able to determine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Violet.</span>—The lines do much credit to your tenderness
of heart and love for your parents, but as poetry they
are not worth much, and are full of faults.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Consumption.</span>—We regret that we cannot give you
any information, as we do not know the medicine by
name, and we could not advise anyone to use it
without the consent of a doctor. We should think a
change of climate would be advisable. Cold, dry
climates are apparently more recommended now than
warm ones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Die Lorelei.</span>—The lines you send have some power
about them, but they are not correct in rhythm nor
in construction. Count the feet and position of the
beats in each line carefully while composing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Marion Moss.</span>—Seals are found in the Arctic seas.
Dundee and Hull are the principal British ports
whence the seal-fishers sail. They are also found in

<p><span class="smcap">Seven Years for Rachel</span> must get her sister to
read aloud, alone, and with someone slowly and
carefully, being particularly careful to take her
breath regularly, easily, and deeply when reading or
speaking. The lungs must be well filled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A Christian.</span>—We agree with your mother that you
are both very young, and had better wait till you be
older. Then we should repeat to you the saying of
Christ, “Have salt in yourselves,” which means that
you must form your opinions and actions on eternal
principles, which are the salt which should savour
our lives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tilda.</span>—We quite agree with you that the manners of
lady district visitors should be very courteous, and
that they should certainly knock at people’s doors,
and not go in until they be asked, nor should they
go at the dinner hour. Alas! good breeding and
sound common-sense seem both rare qualities everywhere.
Either of them would have made your
visitors behave differently.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gipsy.</span>—You should say, “Lady So-and-so,” and write
it with a capital “L.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ethel.</span>—Show your teeth to a dentist. We regret
that we could not give you a recommendation of the
kind. Your medical man would do so. The loss of
an eye-tooth does not affect the sight. It is believed
that eating very fine white bread has tended to
injure the teeth. Wholemeal bread is the best for
producing good bone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sarah Brown.</span>—You cannot re-silver a good looking-glass
yourself. You must send it to a manufactory
for the purpose. Any furnishing upholsterer or
looking-glass seller would undertake to do that for
you; but you must make a bargain before you send
it, and you might obtain a good secondhand glass at
less cost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dick.</span>—Dentists usually have a medical man to see
and attend to the patient when gas is employed. It
is not dangerous to take it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">{160}</span></p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">In Great Trouble.</span>”—Yours seems a case for a
doctor’s advice. You had better consult one. The
word “silly” is not spelt “scilly,” like the islands of
that name, and “disappointed” should not be written
“dissapointed.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy Drake.</span>—You will find the answer to your
question several times repeated in our correspondence
columns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Evelyn.</span>—We do not place ourselves between our
young readers and their parents, by expressing an
opinion respecting the punishments they inflict. If
severe, we imagine that their statement of the case
you describe would be of a different character from
yours. Probably there were attendant circumstances
which aggravated the misdoing on your part. What
business had you to go out without leave, and not
fully dressed for so doing? Besides, you may have
been disobedient or impertinent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ditto.</span>—You will find instructions in riding in the
monthly part for October 1st, 1881, page 3, vol. iii.,
and, as we told you before, at page 131 in the same
volume. You cannot read figures, one would suppose.
There is a picture of a girl on horseback on
the same page. Look again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jo.</span>—Perhaps you could receive some little pupils daily
for two or three hours at your own home, and teach
them the rudiments of an English education—reading,
writing, arithmetic, grammar, geography, and
needlework.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mother of Six.</span>—The Paddington Green Children’s
Hospital might suit you, boys under twelve years of
age and girls under fourteen being eligible, and no
letters of recommendation being required. Write to
the treasurer, George Hanbury, Esq. 21, Portman-square,
W. There are also the Belgrave Hospital
for Children, 77 and 79, Gloucester-street, S.W.—lady
superintendent, Miss Munro; The Eveline
Hospital for Sick Children, Southwark Bridge-road,
S.E.;—secretary, T. H. Chapman, Esq. All three
are free.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sophia Falconer.</span>—Cod-liver oil is specially beneficial
to consumptive persons or those suffering from
a severe cough, not from the stomach. In cases of
atrophy we should think it would be of service.
Many persons, strong or delicate, find a plunge or
two in the sea of much benefit; but few comparatively
could go into still, cold, fresh water. A cold
sponge bath is quite a different thing, and cold salt-water
sponging of the spine, throat, and chest is
much to be recommended, or a good quick rubbing
with a wet towel half wrung out, and drying with a
rough one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Curly</span> and <span class="smcap">Fluffy</span>.—Avoid meeting the men who try
to force unwelcome attentions upon you. Speak to
your mother about it, and let her direct you. She
can put a stop to the persecution with authority. If
she were to go out with you a few times she could
dismiss them at once. Avoid seeing them, and go
into a shop or turn a different way if they try to join
you. It is an important part of her duty to protect
and chaperone you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">An Old Girl of Poland.</span>—In adopting a new country
it is always wise to be provided with a passport, a
copy of your certificate of baptism, and letters from
your clergyman, and any leading men, magistrates
or others; also your banker, if you have one. Such
papers might prove very valuable as introductions
into society, or to facilitate your obtaining employment.
Besides this, they would be very essential in
case of mistaken identity. No passport is needed
in coming to England, yet it is wise to have one.</p>

<p>J. B.—To know the colour called primrose, you have
only to look at the flower and at the enamelled or
painted representations of it. Why ask anyone else
when your own eyes could act better for you than
any description by another person?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Clansman.</span>—We should like to encourage you to write,
as the lines speak well of the mind and the heart;
but we think you would succeed better in prose than
poetry.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Eucharis Lily.</span>”—We have no recollection of the
MS. of which you speak, and regret you have waited
so long for an opinion. The lines you enclose show
good feeling, but lack originality. We thank you
for your kind letter.</p>

<p>F. A. B.—We feel sincere sympathy for you, and
scarcely know how to advise you. At your early age
you are only eligible for the Children’s Hospital,
Great Ormond Street, W.C. You might write for
particulars to the lady superintendent. You would
have to supply certificates both as to character and
health.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gertrude McKenzie.</span>—No licence is required to
enable you to keep a registry office for servants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snowdrops.</span>—Certainly, wear your gloves in church.
Why not? A correspondent some time ago advised
that maidenhair ferns should be watered with tea,
and tea-leaves from the tea-pot should be put round
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Inez</span> and <span class="smcap">Philip</span>.—We are of opinion that the amount
allowed by your brother for his dinner is much in
excess of what is needed, and may prove a temptation
to him if continued. We were interested
in your letter, and we hope your mutual happiness
will long be continued.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One You Have Benefited.</span>—Many thanks for your
kind letter. We quite see all your difficulties, but
we think you must not make too much of them.
The real use of all training at home is to help young
people to stand alone some day, and act in the fear of
God, for themselves; they cannot be always children,
nor in leading strings, so you must excite in them
conscientiousness and a constant desire to do right.
The conduct they propose, <i>i.e.</i>, of going out and in,
of accepting invitations as they please, without consulting
you, is, in the first place, ill-bred and unladylike.
No one treats the lady of the house, be she
mother or step-mother, in that manner, and even in
society they would not be guests a second time in
any house where they ignored the lady who invited
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alea Europea.</span>—In the “Chapel in the Tower,” by
Mr. Bell, we find the following notice of Arthur
Pole, who, with his brother Edmund, was imprisoned
for life, and died in the Tower—They were
the sons of Sir Geoffrey Pole, and grandsons of
Margaret of Clarence, Countess of Salisbury. Cardinal
Pole was, therefore, their uncle. In 1562 they
were implicated in a conspiracy to depose Queen
Elizabeth, and place Mary Queen of Scots on the
throne. It was also alleged that one of them designed
to marry her. They were tried for high
treason at Westminster Hall, 26th February, 1562,
and sentenced to be executed as traitors at Tyburn.
The sentence was commuted by Queen Elizabeth to
imprisonment for life in the Tower, and on the walls
of the Beauchamp Tower, which was their prison,
their names will be found carved several times. The
last written was as follows:—“A passage perillous
makethe a port pleasante, I. H. S., 1568, Arthur
Pole, aged 37.” The date of his death and that of
his brother seems not to be known, but both
were dead in 1578, and buried in the chapel in the
Tower.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daisy.</span>—Take no notice of the matter, unless you are
directly charged, when you can deny truthfully the
authorship of such an unmaidenly epistle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Alicia.</span>—If the jewellery be good and old, it is better
to employ a jeweller to clean it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snowstorm.</span>—We think you should go to New Zealand
to your affianced husband, and keep your promise,
especially as you leave a sister at home to take
care of your mother. It would indeed be foolish to
bring him to England if he be doing well out there,
and is able to marry and give you a comfortable
home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sybil.</span>—We think you may need a tonic of some kind.
A little alum and water is sometimes good for
moist hands, but it is never safe to check perspirations,
unless under a doctor’s orders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Buttercup.</span>—We know of no situation easier than a
nurse’s, where there are only one or two children,
unless, perhaps, you could manage to get one as
parlour-maid only.</p>

<p>A. S. F. T. F. (New South Wales).—There would be
no value if the dates of the half-crowns were erased,
because coins of the House of Brunswick are only
valuable when in perfect order.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mizpah.</span>—The word “Mizpah” means a watch-tower.
On a ring it would mean, “The Lord watch between
thee and me, when we are absent from each other,”
a solemn pledge of faithfulness and truth in a betrothal.
It was used as a solemn warning to one
suspected, not trusted, in the original case.</p>

<p>I. H. B.—“Ban” is an Irish prefix, and means
“white.” We cannot find any other clue to the
word, and we think you should have written “Wenham,”
which is the name of a lake near Boston,
U.S.A., from which the ice derives its name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Omega.</span>—The only way to be comfortable is to prevent
the chilblains from coming at first, by rubbing the
place you feel affected with a little dry mustard and
flour very gently, which will generally put the chilblains
back. When a chilblain has broken, a decoction
of poppy-heads with hot water may be soothing,
and bread poultices are used by many people, but we
are doubtful of their expediency. When the inflammation
has subsided, a little creosote ointment may
be used, but when so bad it would be well to consult
a doctor.</p>

<p>R. A. A.—The editor declines, with thanks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dum Spiro Spero.</span>—The words are French, and are
used when picking the leaves from a daisy. They
mean, “He loves me a little, much, passionately, not
at all.” This is one of the many ancient charms, or
really auguries, which we have obtained from unknown
ancestry.</p>

<p>F. A. H. B.—We regret that we can make no use of
your essay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Daddy Longlegs</span> should send her locket to a jeweller’s
to be cleaned and repolished.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady Godiva.</span>—Probably digestion. Ask your doctor
about it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Esther Black.</span>—The notice of the marriage in the
different newspapers is a sufficient announcement to
friends at a distance. Neither cards nor wedding-cake
are sent now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Florence Moore.</span>—Does your sister wish to look like
a balloon, tied in at the middle with a string? or,
still worse, does she wish to cut her liver in two?
Her other plan, “to drink vinegar,” would so thin
her blood that she would exchange her wholesome
fat for dropsy, and become blown out like a skin-bag
used for water in the deserts. For your own infirmity
you should wear a backboard and faceboard daily
while at your studies. We have often described and
prescribed them already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Curious.</span>—The origin of the name given by Handel to
his composition called “The Harmonious Blacksmith”
was a very natural one. He was on a visit
to the Duke of Chandos, at Edgware, and, overtaken
by heavy rain, he took shelter in a smith’s forge.
The ringing strokes of the hammer, combined with
the song of the smith, told a story to the lively
imagination of the composer, and gave birth to the
piece in question.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Laura.</span>—It is not very evident as to when the Manx
House of Keys was first established, but it existed
in the time of the Dane King, Orry, at the
beginning of the tenth century. This sovereign
established an independent throne in Mona. The
term “Keys” is derived from <i>Kiare es feed</i>, “twenty-four,”
and applied to that number of men of the
island who form the Lower House, while the Upper
House, or Council, is appointed by the crown, and
consists of the bishop, archdeacon, clerk of the rolls,
and some civil officials.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strawberry Cream.</span>—Have you learnt any branch
of domestic service? If so, make use of it. Better
trained servants are much required. You might, at
least, look for a situation as schoolroom maid, under
nurse, or mother’s help. These would serve to give
you practical training.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lolly.</span>—It is for ladies to recognise gentlemen, if acquaintances,
not the reverse. This being the case,
we do not see what your bowing to your clergyman
can have to do with “fastness.” Of course, the
character of the recognition must depend on your
position in life. Good Friday is a fast, not a feast
day. That is the reason, as you will perceive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Admirer of the G.O.P.</span>—Why should you ask your
clergyman to give you a severe talking to? If you
know you deserve it, why not administer it to yourself?
Tell your mother that you lament your want
of self-control and respect in giving way to unseemly
ill-temper, and ask her to help you by a timely check
and reproof, and by her prayers to rule your spirit.
“He that ruleth his spirit is greater than he that
taketh a city.” Leaving off your spectacles will not
only make your eyes ache, but injure them, by overstraining
the nerves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Enid.</span>—If the ends of your hair split, you should have
them carefully singed by a hairdresser accustomed
to do so. You might set all on fire if you attempted
to do so yourself. Improve your handwriting by
writing copies daily, and perfect your acquaintance
with the first three or more rules in arithmetic, and
then you will be eligible for a situation as shop assistant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gretta’s Sister.</span>—A surgeon should examine your
sister’s tongue to see whether it be paralysed. If she
can hear, then no other alphabet is needed for her
than ours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Young Stepmother.</span>—The advice of your governess
is good. As you have so high an opinion of her discretion,
as well as amiability and experience, you
had better give her the due authority to act for you.
In a month’s time, or during the first quarter, you
will see with what success it is attended. One thing
is certain, obedience must be enforced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hope</span> has some poetic feeling, but whether she will
rise to the level of “poetry” in future we could not
say, nor could we recommend any magazine or publisher
likely to take literary and poetical compositions.
That is a question for the industry and perseverance
of the writer to solve.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dorothy Forster.</span>—The lines you send us are very
halting, both as to rhyme and reason.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cherry Ripe.</span>—The word “fiat” means an order or
decree. We thank you for your good wishes and
praise of our paper.</p>

<p>J. F. C.—We have pleasure in giving out readers the
address of the Santa Claus Society, for providing
toys and dolls for children in hospitals. To make
them during leisure hours would be a nice occupation
for young people. For the benefit of those
who would like to aid in a truly charitable and
Christian work, as well as for the sake of the poor
children, we copy your address, as one of the
managers of the society—Miss J. F. Charles, Hillside,
Southwood-lane, Highgate, N.</p>

<p>A. M. C.—There is a home of rest at 9, Albion-place,
Ramsgate. Apply to Miss Bennett. You may be
taken in for three weeks, and the lowest terms for
board, lodging, and attendance are 10s. a week.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pomme de Terre.</span>—We have seen the grave of the
late novelist, Charles Reade, to which you refer,
and the outside public knows no more than just what
the inscription states. This is all we can say in
reply.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">White Heather.</span>—The falling of the hair is often
due to a condition of the general health and failure
of nerve power, and the remedies need to be internally
administered, as well as externally. Go to a
skin doctor, and obtain his advice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mary Leeming</span> and <span class="smcap">Alice Haughton</span>.—Some collectors
of insects use the fumes of chloroform or
brimstone. Where there are many wild flowers you
will find butterflies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Progress.</span>—Yes, women have been returned to Parliament
in past times. In 1360 writs were issued,
to four abbesses, requiring their attendance at
Westminster, and the year following five ladies of
the nobility were likewise returned (35th Edward III.)—viz.,
Marie Countesse de Norff, Alianor Countesse
de Ormand. Agnes Countesse de Pembrook, Philippa
Countess March, and Catherine Countesse de Atholl.
Whether they actually took their seats, we do not
say positively. The only woman ever made a Freemason
was Miss St. Leger, a daughter of Lord
Doneraile, about the year 1739.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nil Desperandum.</span>—You may say “intreat,” but
“entreat” is more correct.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
